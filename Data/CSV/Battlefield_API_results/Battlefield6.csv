Battle Line at Railroad Cut,"1421 W Lexington Ave, Independence",Independence,4,2,39.0873598,-94.4322575,"point_of_interest, establishment","Glad  someone  took  the  time  to  create  this  place  on  google.  So  many  places  where historical  events go  unmarked  and  unlocated.  Not  to  much  here  other  than  the  marker  and  a  pocket  park.  This  was  more  of  skirmish  than  a  full  on  battle.  However,  it  is  important historically.  If  you  can  block  out  the  traffic  noise  you  can  get  a  sense  of  how  it  was  as  this  area  is  more  suburban  and  less  developed  than  the   main  parts  of  Independence."

The owner & everyone working the store are so kind & helpful. Great place to shop & to donate to"
