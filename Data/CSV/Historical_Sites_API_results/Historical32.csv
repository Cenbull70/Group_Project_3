Geodetic Center of North America,Tipton,Tipton,3,8,39.224087,-98.542152,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF ALL SOCIETY IS A BRONZE PLATE MARKS THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOT ON THIS CONTINENT TO SURVEYORS AND MAP MAKERS. ENGRAVED IN THE BRONZE IS A CROSS-MARK AND ON THE TINY POINT WHERE THE LINES CROSS DEPEND THE SURVEYS OF A SIXTH OF THE WORLDS SURFACE. THIS IS THE GEODETIC CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES, THE ""PRIMARY STATION"" FOR ALL NORTH AMERICAN SURVEYS.

IT WAS LOCATED IN 1901 BY THE U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. LATER CANADA AND MEXICO ADOPTED THE POINT AND ITS SUPPORTING SYSTEM AS THE BASE FOR THEIR SURVEYS AND IT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE ""NORTH AMERICAN DATUM."" WHAT GREENWICH IS TO THE LONGITUDE OF THE WORLD, THEREFORE, A KANSAS PASTURE IS TO THE LINES AND BOUNDARIES OF THIS CONTINENT.

IT MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC CENTER OF THE U. S. WHICH IS 42 MILES NORTH, IN SMITH COUNTY."
Fort Hays State Historic Site,"1472 US Highway 183 Alt, Hays",Hays,4.6,222,38.862995,-99.341484,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great place to see how the old forts were laid out during the westward expansion. They have been able to preserve two of the officers' homes and the enlisted men's barracks. The foundations are shown for the commanding officer's home that was sadly sold and moved away. Even the officer's outhouse is there!

The museum part of the visitor center is well done, and the short movies are well done. They have dealt with culturally sensitive topics, too.

I highly recommend seeing this site if you are traveling through or if you live there. Great for all ages."

Barbed Wire Museum,"120 1st St, La Crosse",La Crosse,4.6,56,38.5246153,-99.311587,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great museum that’s kind of nondescript from the outside. You’ll see the two large balls of barbed wire.
Once inside it has multiple large rooms that are super carefully curated. There’s a nice woman that takes care of the museum and keep it super tidy.

They’ve everything from the history of the south west, to the uses of Barbed wire, how it was made, all the variations, and a room that’s a route 66 museum. There is art made with Barbed wire, all carefully displayed and very informative. This was one of the highlights of our route 66 trip.

It’s free but they take donations which will gladly left."
Bob Dole's Childhood Home,"1035 N Maple St, Russell",Russell,5,2,38.8957563,-98.8608065,"point_of_interest, establishment",Took a drive by the home. It is private residence so didn’t want to linger too long.  Interesting to see how people grew up.
1886 Stage Coach Mile Marker,Ellsworth,Ellsworth,5,1,38.7462563,-98.26256200000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great piece of history that people really don’t even consider anymore. If you’re in town, definitely worth a short drive to experience road travel & “technology” during the 1800’s."
Sunflower Coal,"415 27th St, Wilson",Wilson,4,3,38.8249243,-98.474255,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you’re into decaying symbols of a bygone time, this’ll be a good stop for you.  My kids and I got a kick out of walking along the railroads, imagining what might have come and gone around the Sunflower Coal buildings. Not to mention, the wide-open Kansas plains provide a breathtaking backdrop for this already photogenic site!

This landmark is only a short, easy drive from the highway. Pop on over if you’re looking to stretch your legs. It’s just one of several lovely cultural sites the town has to offer. You can also find a smattering of local mom-and-pop shops just a stone’s throw away."

I've walked the land around it and discovered all about why Ellsworth was a wicked town. The gun slingers, the cowboys, and even the ladies that kept them entertained. But once I stepped foot in the buildings and all the amazing things of the past, I realized this is a treasure that very few are taking advantage of. Take a step back in future and learn how creative those in the past were, plus come and see if you can connect with who ever  occupies the home. Come for a real adventure."

Frontier Historical Park,"Old Hwy 40, Hays",Hays,4.6,336,38.8637386,-99.3389522,"park, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped at Frontier Historical Park to specifically see the bison, notably the ‘ghost buffalo,’ Ghostbuster. We were surprised to see/learn that Ghostbuster was brought in many years ago, and there is a brand new, unadvertised even more white baby bison who joined the herd. We were lucky that the bison were all hanging near the fence at the southeast corner of their pasture, and we could get great views and photos. Definitely worth a stop! We didn’t check out the rest of the park, but it’s looks beautiful and has a well-maintained disc golf course."

Sternberg Museum of Natural History,"3000 Sternberg Dr, Hays",Hays,4.7,726,38.8890706,-99.2997841,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We had such a great experience overall. The museum is super clean and easy to navigate. They have a variety of things on display from mineral and fossils to live animals and interactive activities. We throughly enjoyed the dinosaurs on display now and my daughter had a great time in the discovery center.

I work with reptiles professionally, venomous snakes specifically, and was thrilled to see an exhibit a about rattlesnakes. I enjoyed the spread of North American species on display. Lots of nice information was available on the boards to read. The enclosures of the rattlesnakes (and other herps throughout the museum) are smaller for some species than I'd prefer but I understand that space is limited and all of the enclosures were clean with various textures, hiding, climbing, and visually appealing decor so it appears that they want to do as well for the animals as they can. A couple of rattlesnakes and the boa were quite overweight though so I'd love to see them again a little bit slimmed down. Regardless, I would absolutely visit again."
