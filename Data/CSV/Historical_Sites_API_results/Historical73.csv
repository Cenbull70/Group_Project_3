Haystack Mound,"R3F9+VM, Brookville",Brookville,5,2,38.824631,-97.9308,"point_of_interest, establishment","Another ancient Native American spiritual mound. This one is a precise conical mound shaped like a stack of strewn hay, hence the name given to this West Saline County natural & artificially man-made by a previous indigenous culture that spanned this area, predominantly Ellsworth and Rice Counties just to the West  and South Southwest of this mound. Nearby Native American mounds that are also nearby are the
•TWIN MOUNDS- in NW Saline Co. (Glendale)

•NORTH POLE MOUND- on the Northern Saline and SouthOttawa Co. line

•IRON MOUND-a few miles east of Salina is a platform Mound that looks just like Monk's Mound in Cahokia

•SOLDIER'S CAP MOUND- a tabletop Mound on the Smoky Hill Weapons Range

•TWIN MOUNDS- near Roxbury in Northern McPherson and SE Saline County.

•CORONADO HEIGHTS- Yep, even Coronado Heights was an ancient Mound that the WPA built a castle on top of in the 1930's proclaiming Francisco Coronado was here. (In truth, this is wrong it was actually SSW of Lindsborg somewhere closer to Lyons or Little River, Kansas area)."
Historic McPherson Sante Fe Depot,"400 N Chestnut St, McPherson",McPherson,4.4,5,38.3723454,-97.6711772,"point_of_interest, establishment",Cool Old Building. Atmosphere was nice. The Old man in Coveralls was a bit Handsy. The Taco were Yummy.
Chisolm Trail Crossing Santa Fe Trail,"30th Ave, Canton",Canton,4,7,38.3770911,-97.3718299,"point_of_interest, establishment","I only gave 3 stars because although I enjoyed driving down the back country roads, the landmarks were vague. Theyvwere well marked out along the route, but you have to use your imagination and knowledge of that era to get a good mental picture of what the trail is all about. The trail is only for serious history buffs."
Twin Mounds,"R45X+W6, Brookville",Brookville,5,1,38.8098712,-97.8519902,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Site of First Free Ferry on Smoky Hill River Marker,"115-101 S 4th St, Salina",Salina,5,1,38.8404167,-97.6069887,"point_of_interest, establishment","When I was growing up in Salina I never knew the importance of Iron Street for the old bridge that used to be there. Since Salina was founded primarily around Iron Ave & Santa Fe, more precisely (Iron Ave & 5th St), which on the SW corner where Carol Lee Donuts is now used to sit the first dwelling ever built in Salina in the year 1858. That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South. Also, anything that sits E of Santa Fe Ave is East in the address, and vice-versa anything W of Santa Fe Ave is West. For instance Salina Community Theater is 303 East Iron and the Smoky Hill Museum is 211 West Iron.]"
Twin Mounds,"VWH4+9R, Westfall",Westfall,4.2,5,38.8784851,-98.0928972,"point_of_interest, establishment",Cool to see but no one is saying the historical significance so I’ll “google” it.
The Flag Our Fathers Saved,"R9MW+MW, Salina",Salina,3,1,38.8341622,-97.6026792,"point_of_interest, establishment",Thought  this  deserved a  photograph  to  prove it  actually  exists. Easy  to  miss  historical  monument.
Lincoln County Kansas Historical Museum,"216 W Lincoln Ave, Lincoln",Lincoln,5,20,39.0403999,-98.15022549999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Entry is by donation: make sure to put some change in their bin and buy some things in the gift shop area.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"
Dickinson County Heritage Center,"412 S Campbell St, Abilene",Abilene,4.7,150,38.9114465,-97.2085839,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This place is very enjoyable! The carousel takes you back a century to a simpler time. The huge collection of phones and the history behind them is very interesting. There is so much to learn here. All of the exhibits are great, including the big barn full of old cars and machinery. Definitely worth the stop!"

Got to meet the owner and hear first hand about the original family! Terry lived with the sisters while he fixed up the mansion, so hearing their stories was great. Our tour guide knew everything about the history of the house and did a great job! Would definitely make sure you visit, and if you get a chance, talk with Terry."

I highly recommend a visit. I just wish we lived in the area so we could participate in all the wonderful things that go on here. The history is amazing. And I believe the mansion has found its forever owner. Joseph's own story, finding this mansion clearly confirms he is the perfect owner.
We had a wonderful time."
Former Santa Fe Depot,Abilene,Abilene,5,3,38.9135312,-97.2147612,"point_of_interest, establishment",We  stumbled  across  this  old  Santa Fe  Railroad  Station  as  we  were  looking  for  all  things railroadia.  This  is currently  used  as  as  the  BNSF  headquarters.  So  do  not  get  too  close  when  taking  photographs  as  sometimes  railroad  employees  get  protective about  their headquarter properties. We visited May 2023.
