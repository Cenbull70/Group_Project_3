We reserved the house so that my family could all stay together while we attended my grandfather's funeral. There was more than enough room for all of my sisters, our spouses, and all of our children. The house was fully stocked and all we needed to worry about was ourselves and our personal effects. It took a lot of stress out of our trip and was so wonderful to be able to be surrounded by family with all of us under one roof throughout the stay. I cannot recommend Cameron's Colonial enough. We will definitely be using it for future stays."
Fike Park,Colby,Colby,4.6,172,39.4000358,-101.0446605,"park, point_of_interest, establishment",I drove all this way to find the mini statue of Liberty. The mini Statue of Liberty was put up by the boy scouts of America in the '50s. There are approximately 20 remaining in the state of Kansas. This would be my fourth statue of Liberty that I have visited. I am mainly upset that I could not add the Statue of Liberty have a new place. This should be added so that people can find it. These monuments are disappearing daily because no one list them. As someone who likes to visit off the wall or off the beaten path tourist attractions this would have been a great find. Yeah I had to find the location on Wikipedia. I intend to visit all of the locations in the state of Kansas.
