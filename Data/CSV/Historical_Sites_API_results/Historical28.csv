Tripoint CO-NE-KS,"Colorado 80758, United States",United States,4.7,3,40.0032228,-102.0517869,"point_of_interest, establishment",Long drive from home. But pretty cool to be in 3 states at once. Unfortunately some of Kansas and all of Nebraska is fenced in that area. No one was there. There is a road straight to the marker. Even though maps suggest a different route.

The gentleman there was extremely knowledgeable and provided us a great tour of the building and the artifacts displayed there. We purchased an Oral History Book that was published in 1998 of folks who had grown up in the area which we found very interesting. The visit to both Goodland and St Francis was  so nice and we were very glad we ventured off the Interstate to explore these friendly towns.

MUSEUM OF CHEYENNE COUNTY,St Francis,St Francis,4.8,26,39.7669131,-101.8029654,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This museum was a nice surprise. We stopped here just to check it out and ended up staying for a while. It's larger than expected and has very detailed displays. Items related to, or made by, the people of Cheyenne County are well labeled and add depth and personal connection to the displays. My favorite parts were the descriptions of the "" soddies"" and the items in the schoolhouse display.
The hours here vary by season, and the museum is free but donations are encouraged."

Being a motorcycle enthusiast, I had to check it out. I was BLOWN AWAY. They had EVERYTHING you can imagine!

The attendant on duty was polite, helpful and warm. The layout of the museum is simple and exhibits were up close and the signs were very informative.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who has even a passing interest in motorcycles. Get off the Interstate and discover this gem for yourself."
