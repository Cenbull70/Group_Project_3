Battle of Punished Woman's Fork National Historic Site,"67871, Scott City",Scott City,4.8,73,38.6435538,-100.9279405,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was maybe the highlight of our trip. We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."

The site is unmolested and presented as it was while the original family lived there.  The property maintains most of it's original furniture and fixtures.  The caretaker/staff member was incredibly knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  100% worth stopping if you enjoy Kansas history and want to see a home that has mostly untouched over time.

Butterfield Overland Despatch Trail Marker,Grinnell,Grinnell,5,2,38.7890678,-100.7629312,"point_of_interest, establishment","in the 1800s the Monument Rocks served as a landmark on the way to Denver, before roads, so this marker is for the Smokey Hill Trail for gold seekers in wagons on their way to Denver."
El Cuartelejo,Scott City,Scott City,4.5,4,38.6768293,-100.9148925,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a fascinating bit of history, connected with Native and Spanish interactions in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, from well before the Revolutionary War.

Mingo - Oldest Active Geocache in the World,Colby,Colby,4.9,64,39.277916,-100.9436992,"point_of_interest, establishment","The new plaque was stolen, apparently. Still a neat piece of obscure history. Biked through en route from Fort Collins CO to Oakley KS. A minivan pulled up as we were leaving to continue east... this cache must see dozens of daily visitors!"
Monument Rocks,Oakley,Oakley,4.8,310,38.7954826,-100.7641158,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This place was pretty awesome.

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

There's a large fire truck in one room which is really cool and very pretty. I had an overall great experience here that was free and it was a long hour route.

Interesting fossils, history, nice people. Lovely gift shop. We loved the painted 1948 Suburban, and we were grateful for their clean little outhouse after we'd driven 90 minutes and spent another hour at Monument Rocks. Recommend stopping here, especially if you like rocks!"
