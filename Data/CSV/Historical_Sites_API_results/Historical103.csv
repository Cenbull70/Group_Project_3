Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Kaw Mission State Historic Site,"500 North Msn, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,61,38.665916,-96.49394099999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped while traveling to stretch our legs on the walking path along the water. This historic site was in front of the parking area for walking. It was an interesting site that we weren't expecting. I don't think it was open that day, and I'm not certain it's a place you can enter. The buildings were nice to see, as well as the information posted near them, on the signs I shared here in my photos."
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, park, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."
Old School House,"10967 Wilmington Rd, Harveyville",Harveyville,5,1,38.7448722,-95.96439149999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Down the road less traveled now but it has a lot of history about the Santa Fe Trail.
Wamego Historical Museum,"406 4th St, Wamego",Wamego,4.7,30,39.2021295,-96.3004304,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The staff was so friendly and told us a lot about the items in the main room.  One of the volunteers opened all of the display building on site so we could see them (school house, store, cabin, etc)."

Goodnow House State Historic Site,"2301 Claflin Rd, Manhattan",Manhattan,4.5,13,39.192832,-96.5955693,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",They didn't open until 2 pm so we waited and it was worth it. The gentleman who gave us the tour was very informative and told great stories.
Allegawaho Memorial Heritage Park,"S 525 Rd, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.3,20,38.6257382,-96.4315409,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","I came here on a whim and it really surprised me. The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"
Native Stone Scenic Byway Historical Marker,Alma,Alma,4.8,19,38.9073333,-96.27991329999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Beautiful Kansas. Mind-boggling stone fencing. Rolling hills and winding roads.

Historical Hand-Dug Well,"401 Road to Oz Highway, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,15,39.3962435,-96.4080357,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's amazing to read about it and to think it was hand dug. It was just sad to see that people thought it was a trashcan of some sort.... no, not the algae because that's going to be a thing in any still water situation. The plastic jugs, the shoes and other garbage floating. It's sad....but it's in a beautiful park area."
Shawnee County Historical Society,"1118 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.7,3,39.0426068,-95.67216909999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Bob did a great job in teaching us. He’s very knowledgeable.

Pioneer Jail,"507 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,13,38.6618794,-96.4807063,"point_of_interest, establishment","Not much to it but it looks authentic. You can go inside the front ""lobby"" and see inside the two jail cells. Pretty sparse!"
First Territorial Capitol State Historic Site,"693 Huebner Rd, Fort Riley",Fort Riley,4.4,43,39.0852807,-96.76210189999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","The capital building itself is pretty cool. There are several neat museums on Fort Riley. I would’ve given it five stars if not for the background check required to enter the base. You will not be allowed to enter without providing a picture ID, Social Security number and fingerprints."
Kimble Castle,"2001 Poyntz Ave, Manhattan",Manhattan,5,2,39.1792267,-96.58871309999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","Kimball Castle is an AMAZING local treasure!! The historic design and incredible grounds are stunning!  I did the home inspection when it sold recently and there was so much to see! The Guest House is beautiful!

There are two interesting historical markers describing the crossing and the military road, plus a pavilion over a single picnic table. Barely enough parking for a couple cars parked single file; since there's no room to turn around, you'll have to back up into the road. This place is also on the opposite side of the creek (and several dozen yards from) the Vieux family cemetery."
