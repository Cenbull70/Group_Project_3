Santa Fe Trail Tracks,"US-400, Fort Dodge",Fort Dodge,4,255,37.7895652,-100.1977533,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Basically impossible to see the tracks as of early October. However, the surrounding views are gorgeous, with prairie grass waving and very colorful. I wonder if they should put up something to block weather, as it seems like all the Santa Fe track sites I visited are deteriorating. It feels like something could be done to preserve them better. Either way, the site is still in a beautiful spot, just beware of the heavy construction traffic on these roads to the site, I do not recommend taking this highway any further than to this site."
