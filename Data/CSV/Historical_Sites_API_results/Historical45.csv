Morton County Historical Society Museum,"370 US-56, Elkhart",Elkhart,4.9,33,37.0036702,-101.8881084,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Captivating museum just off 56 in Elkhart KS. Fantastic journey through the formative years of SW Kansas and the rugged people who sought to thrive in this land, struggled through Dust Bowl days, served in America's wars, and established a productive agricultural region today. Also visit Cimarron National Grasslands while in Elkhart and learn about the historic Santa Fe Trail."
Historic Adobe Museum,"300 E Oklahoma Ave, Ulysses",Ulysses,4.8,31,37.5770652,-101.3552232,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",A sudden change in weather forced us to cancel our distance travel plans so decided to make a short trip to visit this museum since we already had day together planned. Was well worth the 30 minute drive. An excellent museum that showcases the changes in the area over the past 150 years. The exhibits are well put together and organized for a visitor to have an educational tour as you wonder through the museum.  Much more to see than what you might expect for a small town. Admittance is free but consider leaving a donation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.
Point Of Rocks,Elkhart,Elkhart,4.7,51,37.1038513,-101.9386213,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Its free, and you earn it with the 3 miles on dirt road to get there. Cattle were out today, and also a road grader,  which add complexity.  There are some nice vista's and a few hiking areas"

Stanton County Museum,"104 E Highland Ave, Johnson City",Johnson City,4.9,15,37.5633303,-101.7496836,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","A small museum. Has lots of local history. It's not like a big city museum but I really enjoyed it!!! I love the local history and pics...etc. Kind of takes you back to another time! The girl there, attendant, was very nice! There was not a fee to get in but there is a donation box (we left donations as we had planned to pay to get in anyway)."
Caroline Henderson Homestead,Texhoma,Texhoma,3.8,5,36.80511080000001,-101.871791,"point_of_interest, establishment",Not much left to the old place. There are cows roaming the property and the property owner had put up a fence to keep  his cows in. The house looks timeless in its advanced state of decay sitting lonely out on the plains.

I personally was interested in the arrowhead and sharks teeth displays."

Wagon Bed Spring,Sullivan,Sullivan,4.5,2,37.39835619999999,-101.3707193,"natural_feature, establishment","I have tried to get to the spring twice. The roads where flooded the first time and today I could get to the turn off road to the spring and it is fenced off. I went around to two other routes to the spring and they were fenced off as well. Not sure how to get to it. I reached out to the Ulysses tourist board for further information on how to access this national monument.

Update: I received a call back from tourist board and they looked into the matter and made me aware of some road wash outs that were being repaired and an event coming up 8/19/2023. I look forward to visiting then to see the site."
