Butcher Falls,"Rd 14, Sedan",Sedan,5,5,37.1472893,-96.2682028,"point_of_interest, establishment","Nice little waterfall! Wasn’t flowing as big as other times, but just being able to say that I visited a waterfall in Kansas was cool in itself. We brought our lunch and drinks and enjoyed the noise of the waterfall, while sitting on the rocks. Glad they share this with the public!"
Votaw Colony Memorial,"4900-4988 Montgomery County Rd 2200, Coffeyville",Coffeyville,5,1,37.065164,-95.60560699999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was ashamed the state had let it become overrun by weeds and grass. It was completely covered and I had just happened to stop on the side of the gravel road to see where I was heading next on my back roads trip back home to Omaha.

I looked over and seen something resembling a giant headstone inside the grass and weeds. I immediately started cutting it all down and this is what I discovered. Truly remarkable and a great piece of history!"
Bartlesville Area History Museum,"401 S Johnstone Ave, Bartlesville",Bartlesville,4.9,25,36.74971439999999,-95.9779037,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The stories are fascinating, and the displays are well done. To have so many of Frank Griggs photos documenting the past is a true treasure."
Cherryvale Historical Museum,"215 E 4th St, Cherryvale",Cherryvale,4.3,26,37.2671827,-95.5499421,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Great roadside history attraction if you are passing through the area.  The lady running the museum said if they weren't open you could call the number on the door and someone will usually be available to come down and give a free tour.
Brown Mansion,"2109 S Walnut St, Coffeyville",Coffeyville,4.6,195,37.0199708,-95.6144994,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was so awesome to see! I loved that you got to tour the basement and ballroom, as well as the main rooms. It was a very in-depth tour with a great guide. There's plenty of parking, be there about 10 min before the start time. Don't be late, they're very punctual with the start time and its a singular volunteer so the doors lock once the tour starts. If you are there early, like we were, you can take the time to walk the grounds and check out the garden/yard and the info boards with historical information. They have a small gift area and sell things like t-shirts, salt water taffy, and bottles of water. The tour takes about an hour. You can buy this as a combo ticket that also includes the Dalton Museum. Beautiful home with a lot of surprising tech advancements and original items. Kids 11 & 14 enjoyed the tour as well. There are stairs you'll have to do, but there are handrails to utilize and the older members in the group seemed to handle it fine. Check this place out!"
Covered Rail Bridge New Albany KS,Fredonia,Fredonia,5,4,37.5822417,-95.9561293,"point_of_interest, establishment","This spot is gorgeous. I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."
Parsons Historical Museum,"401 S 18th St, Parsons",Parsons,4.5,46,37.3373895,-95.2626607,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This is an awesome place to learn history about Parsons Kansas. staff is awesome and friendly and treat you like family if you need to know something they tell you and explain everything, I recommend everybody to go check it this place is also free to go to they do take donations"

Longton Calaboose,"106 5th St, Longton",Longton,5,2,37.3782205,-96.07974209999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","Actually kind of cool for what it is. The jail is basically intact and it looks as if bad guys could be locked up in it to this day. Not sure I would drive 1000 miles to see it, but any day trip through Southeast Kansas should include this stop."

Old Mill Dam,"Mill Dam Rd, Fredonia",Fredonia,4.6,42,37.5146161,-95.8491375,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Awesome old mill and dam. Very scenic. Road down to Fall River is very rough so parking at top of mill near water plant and walking down is probably a better choice if you don't have 4WD and more importantly high clearance.
