One of the volunteers opened all of the display building on site so we could see them (school house, store, cabin, etc)."

Historical Hand-Dug Well,"401 Road to Oz Highway, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,15,39.3962435,-96.4080357,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's amazing to read about it and to think it was hand dug. It was just sad to see that people thought it was a trashcan of some sort.... no, not the algae because that's going to be a thing in any still water situation. The plastic jugs, the shoes and other garbage floating. It's sad....but it's in a beautiful park area."
First Territorial Capitol State Historic Site,"693 Huebner Rd, Fort Riley",Fort Riley,4.4,43,39.0852807,-96.76210189999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","The capital building itself is pretty cool. There are several neat museums on Fort Riley. I would’ve given it five stars if not for the background check required to enter the base. You will not be allowed to enter without providing a picture ID, Social Security number and fingerprints."

There are two interesting historical markers describing the crossing and the military road, plus a pavilion over a single picnic table. Barely enough parking for a couple cars parked single file; since there's no room to turn around, you'll have to back up into the road. This place is also on the opposite side of the creek (and several dozen yards from) the Vieux family cemetery."
Wabaunsee County Historical Society & Museum,"227 Missouri Ave, Alma",Alma,4.7,13,39.0126409,-96.2896837,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great little museum of local history, covering Wabaunsee County from its frontier days. Lots and lots of exhibits spread out through the building.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building. Not sure if that might have affected the layout (the part with various historic washing machines seem to be rather crowded together, preventing a really good look). But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."
Oregon Trail Monument,"200 E Mission St, St Marys",St Marys,5,1,39.1910513,-96.06169840000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Amazing marker. Absolutely incredible that the Oregon Trail passed right through St. Marys. This monument was erected by Spanish-American War veterans.

Unfortunately, it is in a rather inconvenient location, sandwiched in between the railroad and a sometimes extremely busy US 24. Not really the easiest spot to get to."
World War I Memorial Arch,"200 E Mission St, St Marys",St Marys,5,3,39.1912011,-96.06132079999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",The arch is next to a convent thus happened to stumble upon women of the cloth. A quite and meditative place to take a stroll on. A great site to lear more about the part St. Mary’s played in the early stages our our history as well as religion.
The California-Oregon Trail Historical Marker,Westmoreland,Westmoreland,4.4,5,39.3812527,-96.4051985,"point_of_interest, establishment","This was a nice surprise finding the rest/picnic stop along our route on our way to Pawnee SRA.  It was an easy off and on from the road, and plenty of parking for our rig.  Across the road was the rest of the rest stop but perhaps too small for us to get in and out of the space with our rig.  But it was cool to read the description of this route and how for the period notes it was a regular route to California/Oregon via the wagon trail.  Good history.  The area could use a bit of maintenance but otherwise safe and clean"
Vieux Crossing Cemetery and Historical Marker,Louisville,Louisville,4.6,5,39.25588399999999,-96.246578,"point_of_interest, establishment",We found this spot while looking for an Oregon trail crossing. Interesting historical information hidden in Kansas.
