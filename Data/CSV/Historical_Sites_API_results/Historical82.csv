Kinsley Halfway Sign,Kinsley,Kinsley,4.5,22,37.9173024,-99.423125,"point_of_interest, establishment","This was a great stop off during a long road trip.  There is a small museum, a few outdoor exhibits, and of course the Half Way sign.  Parking is a breeze, it won't take you very long to see everything, but it's one of those places you will be glad you stopped at when you think back to your trip.  If you can venture to this spot on your way to wherever you should do so."
Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.73800519999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

Fromme-Birney Round Barn,"O St, Mullinville",Mullinville,4.8,55,37.5268447,-99.5088388,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","When driving down the dirt road,  approaching the round barn, I thought how neat it was that it was in the middle of nowhere. I know that may not make sense, but when you‚Äôre living in a large city, small things like this put a smile on my face.

The barn is unattended but is well maintained and operates on the honor system.

Unlatch the barn door and turn the lights on. You can read about its history on the walls located on the first level inside the barn."

You can see some cool old artifacts and photos through the windows.  Apparently it was opened at one time, but for some reason, has now fallen into disrepair.  Looks abandoned.

I am so happy we did. It is a beautiful place, even if a bit sad. The Church is no longer an active parish due to declining population. However, you can almost feel the years of faith contained in the bricks and mortar. I highly recommend you go the few miles off the highway and take a look for yourself."
