Adults will love the beautifully-simple landscaping with the native grasses, split-rail fences and the views of prairie, lake and sky.   Kids could play forever in the old town setting.  Jefferson County saved a bunch of houses and businesses from the 1800s and early 1900s and moved them together to make a little town from the past.  Filmmakers should use this as a set.  The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.  Even if it's closed, you can still look inside the buildings to see what an old doctor's office or what the old grocery or hardware store had in it.  Plus there is a wonderful sculpture of a prairie wind wagon being swept up into a tornado.  I love it there."

They have a lot of work to bring the home back to its grand days, but they have done so much with it thus far. I really enjoyed seeing the home and learning interesting facts about the Harvey family.
