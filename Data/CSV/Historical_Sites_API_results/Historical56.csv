It has a bunch of mini fines along with the big plaque. It has a bench and the prairie all around. An asphalt driveway gets you around the entire thing and then back out to the highway. You could possibly miss it if you were not looking for it. If you get direction you have to turn, it is not right along the highway."

WALRONDS STOCKADE
1870

MARKER
STOOD THE ONLY
COMPLETED STOCKADE IN OSBORNE COUNTY
ERECTED 1938

Walrond’s Stockade (also called Well’s Stockade) – April 1870

On April 29, 1870, A. B. and D. R. Crosby, Zachary Walrond, Albert Wells, and J. J. Wiltrout settled on the north bank of the North Fork Solomon River in what is now Bethany Township of Osborne County, Kansas.  At that time their nearest location for supplies and mail, Minneapolis, Kansas, was some 80 miles away downstream.  In May 1870 the group erected a log cabin and stockade for defense. The stockade was 100 feet in diameter. The vertical poles that made up the walls were 10 to 12 feet tall, sharpened on the top end. Portholes from which to view and shoot were cut in the walls every few feet and at different heights.

They did so none too soon, for on May 29th about twenty-five Indians made their appearance at the stockade and commenced firing.  But the assault was returned with such accuracy and heat the dismayed Indians speedily withdrew.  A second raid made a few days later on the stockade but that also speedily ended without any notable tragedies. The little fortification happened to be on the alert when the third and last raid occurred in early July.  The Indians had just been repulsed at Bullocks Ranche and were in ill temper.  Again they were held back by the accuracy and firepower coming from the stockade, and, unable to do much of anything else, they killed and butchered a yoke of oxen tied up outside and reluctantly rode on.  After another year the stockade was no longer needed and was abandoned.

In 1938 a monument was erected 400 yards to the west from the stockade site alongside U.S. Highway 281 a mile or so south of the city of Portis, where it can be viewed today."
