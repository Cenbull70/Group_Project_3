Fromme-Birney Round Barn,"O St, Mullinville",Mullinville,4.8,55,37.5268447,-99.5088388,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","When driving down the dirt road,  approaching the round barn, I thought how neat it was that it was in the middle of nowhere. I know that may not make sense, but when you‚Äôre living in a large city, small things like this put a smile on my face.

The barn is unattended but is well maintained and operates on the honor system.

Unlatch the barn door and turn the lights on. You can read about its history on the walls located on the first level inside the barn."
