Historic Lecompton,"640 E Woodson Ave, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.7,132,39.0445903,-95.3921085,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",This museum is definitely worth your time for a nostalgic trip to the past. From the beautiful and historic Christmas tree displays to all of the artifacts from the wars and time gone past. This museum is a real gem.
Tonganoxie Historical Society and Museum,"201 W Washington St, Tonganoxie",Tonganoxie,4.9,34,39.1054415,-95.09654119999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Was so surprised to see a picture of my grandmother! She grew up here on the Korb farm but didn‚Äôt know they had information about them at the museum!
Leavenworth County Historical,"1128 5th Ave, Leavenworth",Leavenworth,4.6,52,39.3066282,-94.9178134,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was an incredible house kept in pristine condition! Amazing attention to detail including pocket doors, transom windows, stained glass, hand-carved woodwork, and very knowledgeable tour guides!"
McLouth Granite Boulder,"246-298 S Granite St, McLouth",McLouth,4.6,14,39.1961296,-95.20603779999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",It was a lot more impressive 20 years ago before all the layers of pavement layers built up.
Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Grinter Place State Historic Site,"1420 S 78 St, Kansas City",Kansas City,4.5,137,39.074941,-94.76010579999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Amazing experience! The expert on hand gave us a very thorough tour and was exceptionally knowledgeable!!! I'd go back again to learn more about KS. My son, who is 14yo, also really enjoyed the tour- Which is rare for a teenager! No real hands-on activities or touching of objects- may not be the most entertaining for small children."
Monticello Community Historical Society,"23860 W 83rd St, Shawnee",Shawnee,4.3,10,38.97801,-94.862608,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Very small place with a focus on only one man who had a connection with Buffalo Bill Cody. It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, museum, park, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."
Heritage Park Barn,"13600 W 175th St, Olathe",Olathe,5,1,38.8127203,-94.74323110000002,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Constitution Hall State Historic Site,"319 Elmore St, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.6,107,39.0454091,-95.39473219999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",One of the best tours I've ever had. The period-costumed docent gave an inspiring 15 minute chat about the events that happened in Lecompton and its effect on the 1860 election and the history of the United States. The first floor has some well-designed displays.
Memorial Carillon and Campanile,"Memorial Dr, Lawrence",Lawrence,4.8,77,38.9600418,-95.2469352,"point_of_interest, establishment","Our kids and Our Money BELONG here! Best Decision ever made

Old Jefferson Town,"703 Walnut St, Oskaloosa",Oskaloosa,4.5,10,39.21361419999999,-95.3095744,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Worth-the-drive destination.    Adults will love the beautifully-simple landscaping with the native grasses, split-rail fences and the views of prairie, lake and sky.   Kids could play forever in the old town setting.  Jefferson County saved a bunch of houses and businesses from the 1800s and early 1900s and moved them together to make a little town from the past.  Filmmakers should use this as a set.  The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.  Even if it's closed, you can still look inside the buildings to see what an old doctor's office or what the old grocery or hardware store had in it.  Plus there is a wonderful sculpture of a prairie wind wagon being swept up into a tornado.  I love it there."
Shawnee County Historical Society,"1118 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.7,3,39.0426068,-95.67216909999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Bob did a great job in teaching us. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable.
Miami County Kansas Historical Society & Museum,"12 E Peoria St, Paola",Paola,4.7,30,38.5727047,-94.8772177,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Visited to see the annual Miniature Art Exhibition hosted in the Museum. The exhibition is a must see as it showcases wide variety of miniature paintings from all over the world. The Museum on its own is well curated with various artifacts associated with local and Kansas history. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and answered every question with immense patience. Hidden jewel for history buffs."
Asylum Bridge,Osawatomie,Osawatomie,4.6,35,38.50516349999999,-94.941989,"point_of_interest, establishment","Absolutely beautiful, stunning, kind of falling apart, but mother nature is not a force to be reckoned with. heh I love visiting famous and historic old bridges and I was quite shocked to not see any ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù sign on the entrance to the bridge, it is gated, but maybe that‚Äôs just for safety concern?. I wasn‚Äôt about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. üòÖ

I‚Äôm from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it‚Äôs been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don‚Äôt want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a new piece of Kansas history and it‚Äôs well worth a visit!

Visited today for the open house and had a wonderful time. Becky the guide was very knowledgeable and made this visit wonderful. She made my husband interested in the history and he kept wanting to know more.
Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!
