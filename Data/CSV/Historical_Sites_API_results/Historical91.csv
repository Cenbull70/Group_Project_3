Father Padilla Cross and Historic Marker,"1192 Ave M, Lyons",Lyons,4.6,18,38.3475135,-98.27654129999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","A mile north of historic Cow Creek Crossing on the Santa Fe Trail along highway 56 west of Lyon, Kansas."
Barton County Historical Society,"85 US-281, Great Bend",Great Bend,4.7,53,38.3486362,-98.7659099,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",It was a nice place to stop and have our lunch in the shade. So many neat things to see we'll definitely go back when we have more time!
Buffalo Bill's Well on the Santa Fe Trail,"12th Rd, Lyons",Lyons,4,14,38.3338561,-98.27565560000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Unfortunately, the well is no more than a plate welded flush with the ground. It's a nice side trip off the main highway but there's nothing to see but a small sign with limited details. Wish there was more about the Santa Fe Trail crossing which was apparently important enough for someone to dig a well but those details aren't explained. It is a clean area for a quick leg stretch but not much else."
Haystack Mound,"R3F9+VM, Brookville",Brookville,5,2,38.824631,-97.9308,"point_of_interest, establishment","Another ancient Native American spiritual mound. This one is a precise conical mound shaped like a stack of strewn hay, hence the name given to this West Saline County natural & artificially man-made by a previous indigenous culture that spanned this area, predominantly Ellsworth and Rice Counties just to the West  and South Southwest of this mound. Nearby Native American mounds that are also nearby are the
•TWIN MOUNDS- in NW Saline Co. (Glendale)

•NORTH POLE MOUND- on the Northern Saline and SouthOttawa Co. line

•IRON MOUND-a few miles east of Salina is a platform Mound that looks just like Monk's Mound in Cahokia

•SOLDIER'S CAP MOUND- a tabletop Mound on the Smoky Hill Weapons Range

•TWIN MOUNDS- near Roxbury in Northern McPherson and SE Saline County.

•CORONADO HEIGHTS- Yep, even Coronado Heights was an ancient Mound that the WPA built a castle on top of in the 1930's proclaiming Francisco Coronado was here. (In truth, this is wrong it was actually SSW of Lindsborg somewhere closer to Lyons or Little River, Kansas area)."
Historic McPherson Sante Fe Depot,"400 N Chestnut St, McPherson",McPherson,4.4,5,38.3723454,-97.6711772,"point_of_interest, establishment",Cool Old Building. Atmosphere was nice. The Old man in Coveralls was a bit Handsy. The Taco were Yummy.
South Fork Spillman Creek Double Arch Bridge,"KS-181, Sylvan Grove",Sylvan Grove,4.6,14,39.14066469999999,-98.3966433,"point_of_interest, establishment","Cool, early century all local rock double arch bridge. Closed to traffic. Safe off-road parking on the north side.  Picnic gabezo and several historic information signs. Free."
Fry'sRuts,"2939-2941 Ave P, Little River",Little River,5,2,38.3020727,-97.9555163,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Twin Mounds,"R45X+W6, Brookville",Brookville,5,1,38.8098712,-97.8519902,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Twin Mounds,"VWH4+9R, Westfall",Westfall,4.2,5,38.8784851,-98.0928972,"point_of_interest, establishment",Cool to see but no one is saying the historical significance so I’ll “google” it.
Lincoln County Kansas Historical Museum,"216 W Lincoln Ave, Lincoln",Lincoln,5,20,39.0403999,-98.15022549999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Entry is by donation: make sure to put some change in their bin and buy some things in the gift shop area.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"
Hans Hanson House,"211 5th St, Marquette",Marquette,5,1,38.5567074,-97.83188439999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Hoglund Dugout,Lindsborg,Lindsborg,4,28,38.5757608,-97.7025198,"point_of_interest, establishment","Yes, this is difficult to find. But not impossible. This is an incredible moment in history captured. I was awestruck."
McPherson Globe Refiners Statue,"122 E Marlin St, McPherson",McPherson,5,2,38.3703285,-97.6656105,"point_of_interest, establishment",Interesting monument in memory of the 1936 gold medal winning U.S. basketball team
Coronado Heights Castle,"Walking Trail, Falun",Falun,4.7,1488,38.6129915,-97.70321709999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Very cool spot to visit. Was looking for interesting spots not super far off I-70 on my way to Colorado and this was a very good choice.

Amazing views, at least for midwest standards. 10 little cook pits? Ring the area with big stone fireplaces and tables, another massive central fireplace with two big tables, vault toilets, and the Castle itself. Very much worth the visit"
"Little Arkansas Crossing, Santa Fe Trail",Windom,Windom,5,1,38.3048582,-97.9374601,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Fossett Plaza,"2035 Beechcraft Rd, Salina",Salina,5,7,38.7948981,-97.6420682,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you're an avation buff or want a great place to relax, this is a nice little area to check out. A nice monument showing the historic flight of Steve Fosset around the world in February of 2005. There are plenty of benches for sitting near the tarmac.  It's a cool place to watch aircraft coming and going. This place gets busy whenever the Jaded Thunder comes to town. I Love this spot."
White Cross Hill,Smolan,Smolan,3.7,3,38.6669565,-97.691632,"point_of_interest, establishment",Why is this even listed. It’s private property and not open for access.
1886 Stage Coach Mile Marker,Ellsworth,Ellsworth,5,1,38.7462563,-98.26256200000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great piece of history that people really don’t even consider anymore. If you’re in town, definitely worth a short drive to experience road travel & “technology” during the 1800’s."
Sunflower Coal,"415 27th St, Wilson",Wilson,4,3,38.8249243,-98.474255,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you’re into decaying symbols of a bygone time, this’ll be a good stop for you.  My kids and I got a kick out of walking along the railroads, imagining what might have come and gone around the Sunflower Coal buildings. Not to mention, the wide-open Kansas plains provide a breathtaking backdrop for this already photogenic site!

This landmark is only a short, easy drive from the highway. Pop on over if you’re looking to stretch your legs. It’s just one of several lovely cultural sites the town has to offer. You can also find a smattering of local mom-and-pop shops just a stone’s throw away."
Hodgen House Museum Complex,"104 S Main St, Ellsworth",Ellsworth,4.5,29,38.7282831,-98.23267109999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This museum was one complete surprise. I've walked the land around it and discovered all about why Ellsworth was a wicked town. The gun slingers, the cowboys, and even the ladies that kept them entertained. But once I stepped foot in the buildings and all the amazing things of the past, I realized this is a treasure that very few are taking advantage of. Take a step back in future and learn how creative those in the past were, plus come and see if you can connect with who ever  occupies the home. Come for a real adventure."
