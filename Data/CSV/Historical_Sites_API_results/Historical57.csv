It is just unfortunate that it took me so long to visit. As someone who only lived in the area for a short time, I highly suggest coming here to grasp a piece of the history that sorrounds the Geary County communities."
Kansas Historical Marker and Scenic View of Kansas Bluestem Prairie,"1866, Old Hwy 50, Strong City",Strong City,4.7,33,38.4008116,-96.5030268,"point_of_interest, establishment","Very informative, and a good chance to stretch your legs for a minute. I do believe that there could be more here, though: a trashcan, water spigot, a porta-john, etc. More people would definitely stop there if this were so."
Kaw Mission State Historic Site,"500 North Msn, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,61,38.665916,-96.49394099999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped while traveling to stretch our legs on the walking path along the water. This historic site was in front of the parking area for walking. It was an interesting site that we weren't expecting. I don't think it was open that day, and I'm not certain it's a place you can enter. The buildings were nice to see, as well as the information posted near them, on the signs I shared here in my photos."
Ogden Monument,"Huebner Rd, Fort Riley",Fort Riley,4.2,18,39.0643223,-96.79281870000001,"point_of_interest, establishment",Beautiful overlook and outdoor religious area on Fort Riley. If you get a chance to visit definitely recommend even if just for the view

Allegawaho Memorial Heritage Park,"S 525 Rd, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.3,20,38.6257382,-96.4315409,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","I came here on a whim and it really surprised me. The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"

There are several neat museums on Fort Riley. I would’ve given it five stars if not for the background check required to enter the base. You will not be allowed to enter without providing a picture ID, Social Security number and fingerprints."

We were very impressed with the play area: it seems like an enriching place for all ages.  There's a variety of activities, including magnet poetry, Legos, a play garden, shop, and house, and much more.
The exhibits are fun, but I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, I enjoy local history, and there's plenty here."
Red Rocks State Historic Site,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4,25,38.4096136,-96.1753485,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","William Allen White's historic home called Red Rocks is an interesting place steeped in history. It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."
Wabaunsee County Historical Society & Museum,"227 Missouri Ave, Alma",Alma,4.7,13,39.0126409,-96.2896837,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great little museum of local history, covering Wabaunsee County from its frontier days. Lots and lots of exhibits spread out through the building.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building. Not sure if that might have affected the layout (the part with various historic washing machines seem to be rather crowded together, preventing a really good look). But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."
DAR Santa Fe Trail Crossing Monument,Council Grove,Council Grove,4.3,4,38.6528785,-96.57687349999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",There's enough of a pull off for a 26' RV to get in and turn around!  Historic monument that brings attention to what would otherwise be an overlooked spot on the Historic Santa Fe Trail.
