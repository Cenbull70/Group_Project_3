Was well worth the 30 minute drive. An excellent museum that showcases the changes in the area over the past 150 years. The exhibits are well put together and organized for a visitor to have an educational tour as you wonder through the museum.  Much more to see than what you might expect for a small town. Admittance is free but consider leaving a donation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.

The roads where flooded the first time and today I could get to the turn off road to the spring and it is fenced off. I went around to two other routes to the spring and they were fenced off as well. Not sure how to get to it. I reached out to the Ulysses tourist board for further information on how to access this national monument.

Update: I received a call back from tourist board and they looked into the matter and made me aware of some road wash outs that were being repaired and an event coming up 8/19/2023. I look forward to visiting then to see the site."
