The road to it is a long dusty country gravel road but is an enjoyable ride. The pathway up to the top of the hill where the rock is placed is long ( close to a mile) but my small 4x2 truck made it up effortlessly. I chose to drive very slowly since it’s not maintained in any way.

When we were there on Memorial Day weekend the wild mustangs were visible nearby."

I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."

The museum part of the visitor center is well done, and the short movies are well done. They have dealt with culturally sensitive topics, too.

I highly recommend seeing this site if you are traveling through or if you live there. Great for all ages."

They’ve everything from the history of the south west, to the uses of Barbed wire, how it was made, all the variations, and a room that’s a route 66 museum. There is art made with Barbed wire, all carefully displayed and very informative. This was one of the highlights of our route 66 trip.

We were lucky that the bison were all hanging near the fence at the southeast corner of their pasture, and we could get great views and photos. Definitely worth a stop!

The museum is super clean and easy to navigate. They have a variety of things on display from mineral and fossils to live animals and interactive activities. We throughly enjoyed the dinosaurs on display now and my daughter had a great time in the discovery center.

I work with reptiles professionally, venomous snakes specifically, and was thrilled to see an exhibit a about rattlesnakes. I enjoyed the spread of North American species on display. Lots of nice information was available on the boards to read. The enclosures of the rattlesnakes (and other herps throughout the museum) are smaller for some species than I'd prefer but I understand that space is limited and all of the enclosures were clean with various textures, hiding, climbing, and visually appealing decor so it appears that they want to do as well for the animals as they can. A couple of rattlesnakes and the boa were quite overweight though so I'd love to see them again a little bit slimmed down. Regardless, I would absolutely visit again."

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding.

As another reviewer commented, the museum is definitely geared toward adults, and I concur. However, children might be engaged for an hour or so exploring the classically restored building and viewing items from previous generations. The building has been magnificently restored to its original stately bearing, which in and of itself makes a visit worth one's time and effort. Don't forget to leave a donation if you can as this non-profit museum is well worth preserving for future generations."

Additionally there are many steps to the top, thus unfortunately if you have mobility issues I also would not recommend this for you."

Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.7380052,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

I work with reptiles professionally, venomous snakes specifically, and was thrilled to see an exhibit a about rattlesnakes. I enjoyed the spread of North American species on display. Lots of nice information was available on the boards to read. The enclosures of the rattlesnakes (and other herps throughout the museum) are smaller for some species than I'd prefer but I understand that space is limited and all of the enclosures were clean with various textures, hiding, climbing, and visually appealing decor so it appears that they want to do as well for the animals as they can. A couple of rattlesnakes and the boa were quite overweight though so I'd love to see them again a little bit slimmed down. Regardless, I would absolutely visit again."

That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South. Also, anything that sits E of Santa Fe Ave is East in the address, and vice-versa anything W of Santa Fe Ave is West.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

The Dam itself isn’t directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you’ll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

I visited in December so had no issues with bugs as others reported.  The trail goes up by the spring and crosses over the top of rock outcroppings. Pretty walk. Easy enough for families but would advise that there are no railings for safety if you have very small children. It loops back across the lawn, and depending on water flow, you may have to contend with a wet crossing at the far end. The site was not trashed up, but there are no trash cans, so pack out trash to preserve the beauty. There are also no facilities of any kind but a couple of picnic tables that would be shady in the summer.  The open lawn might be a fun spot for a game of frisbee though!"

The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building.

But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."

I work with reptiles professionally, venomous snakes specifically, and was thrilled to see an exhibit a about rattlesnakes. I enjoyed the spread of North American species on display. Lots of nice information was available on the boards to read. The enclosures of the rattlesnakes (and other herps throughout the museum) are smaller for some species than I'd prefer but I understand that space is limited and all of the enclosures were clean with various textures, hiding, climbing, and visually appealing decor so it appears that they want to do as well for the animals as they can. A couple of rattlesnakes and the boa were quite overweight though so I'd love to see them again a little bit slimmed down. Regardless, I would absolutely visit again."

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

MARKER
STOOD THE ONLY
COMPLETED STOCKADE IN OSBORNE COUNTY
ERECTED 1938

Walrond’s Stockade (also called Well’s Stockade) – April 1870

On April 29, 1870, A. B. and D. R. Crosby, Zachary Walrond, Albert Wells, and J. J. Wiltrout settled on the north bank of the North Fork Solomon River in what is now Bethany Township of Osborne County, Kansas.  At that time their nearest location for supplies and mail, Minneapolis, Kansas, was some 80 miles away downstream.  In May 1870 the group erected a log cabin and stockade for defense. The stockade was 100 feet in diameter. The vertical poles that made up the walls were 10 to 12 feet tall, sharpened on the top end. Portholes from which to view and shoot were cut in the walls every few feet and at different heights.

They did so none too soon, for on May 29th about twenty-five Indians made their appearance at the stockade and commenced firing.  But the assault was returned with such accuracy and heat the dismayed Indians speedily withdrew.  A second raid made a few days later on the stockade but that also speedily ended without any notable tragedies. The little fortification happened to be on the alert when the third and last raid occurred in early July.  The Indians had just been repulsed at Bullocks Ranche and were in ill temper.  Again they were held back by the accuracy and firepower coming from the stockade, and, unable to do much of anything else, they killed and butchered a yoke of oxen tied up outside and reluctantly rode on.  After another year the stockade was no longer needed and was abandoned.

In 1938 a monument was erected 400 yards to the west from the stockade site alongside U.S. Highway 281 a mile or so south of the city of Portis, where it can be viewed today."

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

Temperature was in the high 90s, and typical of Kansas, quite windy. The ceremony was outside, so we sat for longer than an hour in the hot sun, and dealing with wind. During the meal, we spent more effort fighting flies than we did eating. The entire day was utterly miserable. It seems foolish to build a venue that is supposed to be elegant, and not install air conditioning. Most weddings are in the summer; this place is not suitable for a summer wedding. The terrain getting from the parking area to the barn is a bit rugged, which is a problem for people who are not sure-footed. Only one toilet in the ladies room was working, so the line was very long. The rest room is located in a tight corner where it became ridiculously congested.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."

The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.

I wasn’t about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. 😅

I’m from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it’s been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don’t want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it’s a new piece of Kansas history and it’s well worth a visit!

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5.0,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn’t directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you’ll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

We needed to stretch our legs from the long drive and the winery shares my daughter's name so we thought it would be a fun quick pit stop. What a great decision. The winery is very small but is beautiful! The owner and the couple working at the counter we so welcoming, informative, and engaging. The wines were unique and worth trying. We were on a tight time schedule and while we had only planned to stay for about 15-20 minutes we ended up staying at least an hour. Our only regret was that we did not know about this place sooner as we would have contacted them to stay overnight in their adorable  ""shed."" While the winery is 8 miles off the highway on dirt roads in the middle of nowhere (from a city dweller perspective) it was WELL worth the drop in to be able to breathe and rest."

It is a renovated church into a VRBO. It has four bedrooms and an extra bunk bed in the basement with four bathrooms and lots of common space upstairs and down. The property itself isn't very large, so there isn't much room for outdoor activities, but our family appreciated the acoustics of the church nave area for our family devotions and hymns while we were there. They even incorporated church furniture into the renovation, like using the altar for the kitchen island, and the baptismal font into a bathroom vanity. It is sad to see churches close, but nice to see that this one can still be used and preserved in this unique way."

We stayed in Hill Top where about half of the sites were pull through, all in the sun, gravel, water, electricity.  We were there during a hazardous bacteria warning for the water so we could not take advantage of the beaches or fishing, but I'd guess it is usually lovely and a great place for families.  Some of the roads to get into the campgrounds have big chunks missing or pot holes which can be hard on tow vehicles and RVs.  Other campgrounds (old marina and eagle view) within the Park had sites with much more shade and they were lovely.  Bath houses were clean (the ones we used).  No dumpster or bathroom/house in Hill Top.  We saw some wildlife-hog nosed snake racoon, lots of birds.  Stockton is just 10 minutes away and they have dinner good things for kids-parks, playgrounds, public pool.  Our purpose for being in the area was visiting Nicodemus national historical site."

As another reviewer commented, the museum is definitely geared toward adults, and I concur. However, children might be engaged for an hour or so exploring the classically restored building and viewing items from previous generations. The building has been magnificently restored to its original stately bearing, which in and of itself makes a visit worth one's time and effort.

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

I wasn’t about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. 😅

I’m from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it’s been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don’t want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it’s a new piece of Kansas history and it’s well worth a visit!

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

No dumpster or bathroom/house in Hill Top.  We saw some wildlife-hog nosed snake racoon, lots of birds.

Asylum Bridge,Osawatomie,Osawatomie,4.6,35,38.50516349999999,-94.941989,"point_of_interest, establishment","Absolutely beautiful, stunning, kind of falling apart, but mother nature is not a force to be reckoned with. heh I love visiting famous and historic old bridges and I was quite shocked to not see any “No Trespassing” sign on the entrance to the bridge, it is gated, but maybe that’s just for safety concern?. I wasn’t about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. 😅

I’m from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it’s been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don’t want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it’s a new piece of Kansas history and it’s well worth a visit!

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5.0,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn’t directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you’ll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

WALRONDS STOCKADE
1870

MARKER
STOOD THE ONLY
COMPLETED STOCKADE IN OSBORNE COUNTY
ERECTED 1938

Walrond’s Stockade (also called Well’s Stockade) – April 1870

On April 29, 1870, A. B. and D. R. Crosby, Zachary Walrond, Albert Wells, and J. J. Wiltrout settled on the north bank of the North Fork Solomon River in what is now Bethany Township of Osborne County, Kansas.  At that time their nearest location for supplies and mail, Minneapolis, Kansas, was some 80 miles away downstream.  In May 1870 the group erected a log cabin and stockade for defense. The stockade was 100 feet in diameter. The vertical poles that made up the walls were 10 to 12 feet tall, sharpened on the top end. Portholes from which to view and shoot were cut in the walls every few feet and at different heights.

They did so none too soon, for on May 29th about twenty-five Indians made their appearance at the stockade and commenced firing.  But the assault was returned with such accuracy and heat the dismayed Indians speedily withdrew.  A second raid made a few days later on the stockade but that also speedily ended without any notable tragedies. The little fortification happened to be on the alert when the third and last raid occurred in early July.  The Indians had just been repulsed at Bullocks Ranche and were in ill temper.  Again they were held back by the accuracy and firepower coming from the stockade, and, unable to do much of anything else, they killed and butchered a yoke of oxen tied up outside and reluctantly rode on.  After another year the stockade was no longer needed and was abandoned.

In 1938 a monument was erected 400 yards to the west from the stockade site alongside U.S. Highway 281 a mile or so south of the city of Portis, where it can be viewed today."

It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"

Easy enough for families but would advise that there are no railings for safety if you have very small children. It loops back across the lawn, and depending on water flow, you may have to contend with a wet crossing at the far end. The site was not trashed up, but there are no trash cans, so pack out trash to preserve the beauty. There are also no facilities of any kind but a couple of picnic tables that would be shady in the summer.  The open lawn might be a fun spot for a game of frisbee though!"

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.

The owner knows the entire history of the house and how the original family lived in it. Each room is named after one of the original family members and is furnished with period pieces. This is the perfect place for rest and rejuvenation for travelers and locals alike.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."

We are no longer allowed to use the limited outdoor facilities such as the gazebo or the provided outdoor grill.  If we leave anything outside, the manager will throw it out if she sees it (willful destruction of property, by the way).  Additionally, the lifts and elevator are constantly breaking down and take a week (or longer - the lift took 6+ months for someone to finally come fix it), leaving elderly residents and residents with health/mobility issues stranded (which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by the way).  Our rent continues to increase and the property manager does not provide explanation OR copies of rental agreements (again, unlawful).  Maintenance issues are a continuing issue - my own apartment has a leaky roof in various areas, the windows have faulty seals and need maintenance, the stove is faulty and will short out the entire apartment if we attempt to use one side, and our refrigerator/freezer is broken and needs maintenance.  The grounds and drive need maintenance to fix potholes.  I have attempted to contact the property owners but never receive a reply.

That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South.

MARKER
STOOD THE ONLY
COMPLETED STOCKADE IN OSBORNE COUNTY
ERECTED 1938

Walrond’s Stockade (also called Well’s Stockade) – April 1870

On April 29, 1870, A. B. and D. R. Crosby, Zachary Walrond, Albert Wells, and J. J. Wiltrout settled on the north bank of the North Fork Solomon River in what is now Bethany Township of Osborne County, Kansas.  At that time their nearest location for supplies and mail, Minneapolis, Kansas, was some 80 miles away downstream.  In May 1870 the group erected a log cabin and stockade for defense. The stockade was 100 feet in diameter. The vertical poles that made up the walls were 10 to 12 feet tall, sharpened on the top end. Portholes from which to view and shoot were cut in the walls every few feet and at different heights.

They did so none too soon, for on May 29th about twenty-five Indians made their appearance at the stockade and commenced firing.  But the assault was returned with such accuracy and heat the dismayed Indians speedily withdrew.  A second raid made a few days later on the stockade but that also speedily ended without any notable tragedies. The little fortification happened to be on the alert when the third and last raid occurred in early July.  The Indians had just been repulsed at Bullocks Ranche and were in ill temper.  Again they were held back by the accuracy and firepower coming from the stockade, and, unable to do much of anything else, they killed and butchered a yoke of oxen tied up outside and reluctantly rode on.  After another year the stockade was no longer needed and was abandoned.

In 1938 a monument was erected 400 yards to the west from the stockade site alongside U.S. Highway 281 a mile or so south of the city of Portis, where it can be viewed today."

I drove as far as I could, about 1 mile, until I came across a rut several feet long that I didn't know if I could squeeze by, so I parked in the grass and walked the rest of the way.  Aside from being rough, the road is also only wide enough for one vehicle.  There are a few flat pull off areas, but it'd still be tricky if you approached a vehicle coming the opposite direction.  I was there on a Summer day and didn't see anyone, so chances are you'll have the place almost to yourself.  I spent about 15 minutes at the well and the area on top of the hill by the windmill, before walking back to my car.  I didn't check out the Living Water Monument, so I can't speak on that or the road leading to it.  Surprisingly, I didn't find any ticks on me, but it was grasshopper galore.  I arrived back at my car to find roughly 20 or 30 of them on my front bumper.  If you came when the weather is nice, there's a lot of hiking opportunity if you're willing to just walk the roads instead of driving.  It was a nice place to see, but I'm not sure I'll go back."

I know that may not make sense, but when you’re living in a large city, small things like this put a smile on my face.

The barn is unattended but is well maintained and operates on the honor system.

Unlatch the barn door and turn the lights on. You can read about its history on the walls located on the first level inside the barn."

That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South.

Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.7380052,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South. Also, anything that sits E of Santa Fe Ave is East in the address, and vice-versa anything W of Santa Fe Ave is West.

This gem of a local museum dedicated to the history of the Wichita and its environs in Sedgwick County is well worth the effort to explore.  The volunteer staff is friendly, intelligent, and helpful, the museum store is ideal with many small gifts to select from, and the parking is easy on a weekend (I went on a Sunday afternoon when the downtown area was largely uninhabited.) As another reviewer commented, the museum is definitely geared toward adults, and I concur. However, children might be engaged for an hour or so exploring the classically restored building and viewing items from previous generations. The building has been magnificently restored to its original stately bearing, which in and of itself makes a visit worth one's time and effort. Don't forget to leave a donation if you can as this non-profit museum is well worth preserving for future generations."

Historic Philip Houston House B&B,"350 Kansas Ave, Rexford",Rexford,4.6,8,39.4698981,-100.7427046,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This historic home is so beautiful and ornate. The owner knows the entire history of the house and how the original family lived in it. Each room is named after one of the original family members and is furnished with period pieces. This is the perfect place for rest and rejuvenation for travelers and locals alike.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."
Kirch Haus,"438 North Main Street, WaKeeney",WaKeeney,4.7,3,39.0299254,-99.8837575,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a wonderful place to stay with family for a short vacation or getaway. It is a renovated church into a VRBO. It has four bedrooms and an extra bunk bed in the basement with four bathrooms and lots of common space upstairs and down. The property itself isn't very large, so there isn't much room for outdoor activities, but our family appreciated the acoustics of the church nave area for our family devotions and hymns while we were there. They even incorporated church furniture into the renovation, like using the altar for the kitchen island, and the baptismal font into a bathroom vanity. It is sad to see churches close, but nice to see that this one can still be used and preserved in this unique way."

Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.7380052,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

Some of the roads to get into the campgrounds have big chunks missing or pot holes which can be hard on tow vehicles and RVs.  Other campgrounds (old marina and eagle view) within the Park had sites with much more shade and they were lovely.  Bath houses were clean (the ones we used).  No dumpster or bathroom/house in Hill Top.  We saw some wildlife-hog nosed snake racoon, lots of birds.

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you’ll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"

St Jacob's Well,Ashland,Ashland,4.7,18,37.2403698,-99.9818331,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","It was an interesting place.  The road that leads to the well is quite rough.  I wasn't even sure if vehicles were allowed on it.  I started walking, but turned back to grab my car due to the how hot it was and not having planned to hike.  I drove as far as I could, about 1 mile, until I came across a rut several feet long that I didn't know if I could squeeze by, so I parked in the grass and walked the rest of the way.  Aside from being rough, the road is also only wide enough for one vehicle.  There are a few flat pull off areas, but it'd still be tricky if you approached a vehicle coming the opposite direction.  I was there on a Summer day and didn't see anyone, so chances are you'll have the place almost to yourself.  I spent about 15 minutes at the well and the area on top of the hill by the windmill, before walking back to my car.  I didn't check out the Living Water Monument, so I can't speak on that or the road leading to it.  Surprisingly, I didn't find any ticks on me, but it was grasshopper galore.  I arrived back at my car to find roughly 20 or 30 of them on my front bumper.  If you came when the weather is nice, there's a lot of hiking opportunity if you're willing to just walk the roads instead of driving.  It was a nice place to see, but I'm not sure I'll go back."

I wasn’t about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. 😅

I’m from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it’s been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don’t want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it’s a new piece of Kansas history and it’s well worth a visit!

The Dam itself isn’t directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you’ll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you’ll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the “Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)”. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ☺️

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it’s been restored!

We have taken advantage of visiting Little Jerusalem Badlands and Monument Rocks.  So worth it.

We would definitely come back to this site."

It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."
