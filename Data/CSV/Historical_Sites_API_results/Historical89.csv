We were unsure how much time we could spend looking around and only planned for about 30 minutes. We could have easily spent hours there digesting all the amazing history of the area. The staff were so welcoming as well. Definitely worth the visit!

We were particularly interested in the Teterville oilfield area where my parents and sister lived.  The three volunteers who stayed late to help us were amazing representatives of both their craft and community.  Never have I experienced a more knowledgeable, helpful crew.  Thank you for all you did."

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!

Lyon County History Center,"711 Commercial St, Emporia",Emporia,4.5,49,38.4066724,-96.1803561,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We visited for the playroom and exhibits.
We were very impressed with the play area: it seems like an enriching place for all ages.  There's a variety of activities, including magnet poetry, Legos, a play garden, shop, and house, and much more.
The exhibits are fun, but I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, I enjoy local history, and there's plenty here."
Red Rocks State Historic Site,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4,25,38.4096136,-96.1753485,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","William Allen White's historic home called Red Rocks is an interesting place steeped in history. It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

If you stop in Emporia, you should definitely snap a quick pic here!

What made our visit so great was our visit with Mike, the museum guide. He was so anxious to talk to us about the exhibits and point out things we wouldn't want to miss. It is two-stories, that include a large model train town on the first floor, and an old one-room classroom, Victorian living room, kitchen, ice cream parlor, and a general store on the second floor. We stayed over an hour to see all the items that Mike pointed out. We loved the story about the Naked Voters! The museum is free but everyone will want to contribute to the donation box."
