The gentleman there was extremely knowledgeable and provided us a great tour of the building and the artifacts displayed there. We purchased an Oral History Book that was published in 1998 of folks who had grown up in the area which we found very interesting. The visit to both Goodland and St Francis was  so nice and we were very glad we ventured off the Interstate to explore these friendly towns.

MUSEUM OF CHEYENNE COUNTY,St Francis,St Francis,4.8,26,39.7669131,-101.8029654,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This museum was a nice surprise. We stopped here just to check it out and ended up staying for a while. It's larger than expected and has very detailed displays. Items related to, or made by, the people of Cheyenne County are well labeled and add depth and personal connection to the displays. My favorite parts were the descriptions of the "" soddies"" and the items in the schoolhouse display.
The hours here vary by season, and the museum is free but donations are encouraged."

Being a motorcycle enthusiast, I had to check it out. I was BLOWN AWAY. They had EVERYTHING you can imagine!

A  good  GPS  app  or  a  state atlas  is  recommended  to  find  this  place.  A  more  challenging  place  to  find  but  worth  the  effort.

Kate and Carl were wonderful and attentive hosts both prior to and during our stay. They answered all our questions in a timely manner and have truly thought of everything for the cottage. When they say “fully stocked”, they mean it — from kitchen gadgets, to kids games, to thoughtful touches throughout the home. Our kids also loved riding their bikes around the little lawn loop. We look forward to returning!"
