WALRONDS STOCKADE

ERECTED 1938

Walrond’s Stockade (also called Well’s Stockade) – April 1870

On April 29, 1870, A. B. and D. R. Crosby, Zachary Walrond, Albert Wells, and J. J. Wiltrout settled on the north bank of the North Fork Solomon River in what is now Bethany Township of Osborne County, Kansas.  At that time their nearest location for supplies and mail, Minneapolis, Kansas, was some 80 miles away downstream.  In May 1870 the group erected a log cabin and stockade for defense. The stockade was 100 feet in diameter. The vertical poles that made up the walls were 10 to 12 feet tall, sharpened on the top end. Portholes from which to view and shoot were cut in the walls every few feet and at different heights.

They did so none too soon, for on May 29th about twenty-five Indians made their appearance at the stockade and commenced firing.  But the assault was returned with such accuracy and heat the dismayed Indians speedily withdrew.  A second raid made a few days later on the stockade but that also speedily ended without any notable tragedies. The little fortification happened to be on the alert when the third and last raid occurred in early July.  The Indians had just been repulsed at Bullocks Ranche and were in ill temper.  Again they were held back by the accuracy and firepower coming from the stockade, and, unable to do much of anything else, they killed and butchered a yoke of oxen tied up outside and reluctantly rode on.  After another year the stockade was no longer needed and was abandoned.

In 1938 a monument was erected 400 yards to the west from the stockade site alongside U.S. Highway 281 a mile or so south of the city of Portis, where it can be viewed today."

Cloud County Historical Museum,"635 Broadway St, Concordia",Concordia,4.9,32,39.5706754,-97.6588463,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This is really an impressive museum.  You can tell that the efforts of many citizen volunteers went into making this happen.  That is very much to be respected.  It provides a cross-section of the unique way life in the area past and present.

Geodetic Center of North America,Tipton,Tipton,3,8,39.224087,-98.542152,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF ALL SOCIETY IS A BRONZE PLATE MARKS THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOT ON THIS CONTINENT TO SURVEYORS AND MAP MAKERS. ENGRAVED IN THE BRONZE IS A CROSS-MARK AND ON THE TINY POINT WHERE THE LINES CROSS DEPEND THE SURVEYS OF A SIXTH OF THE WORLDS SURFACE. THIS IS THE GEODETIC CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES, THE ""PRIMARY STATION"" FOR ALL NORTH AMERICAN SURVEYS.

IT WAS LOCATED IN 1901 BY THE U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. LATER CANADA AND MEXICO ADOPTED THE POINT AND ITS SUPPORTING SYSTEM AS THE BASE FOR THEIR SURVEYS AND IT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE ""NORTH AMERICAN DATUM."" WHAT GREENWICH IS TO THE LONGITUDE OF THE WORLD, THEREFORE, A KANSAS PASTURE IS TO THE LINES AND BOUNDARIES OF THIS CONTINENT.

IT MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC CENTER OF THE U. S. WHICH IS 42 MILES NORTH, IN SMITH COUNTY."

Though it's a small area with not much around, the charm lies in its simplicity. There's a quaint chapel you can explore, and the stone features and flags make it a great spot for a photo op. It's a fun outing for the family, perfect for spending quality time together. Bring a picnic and enjoy the serene surroundings. It's a memorable and peaceful place to visit."

We visited during the “off-season”. The chapel was open and we were able to write a note. We took pictures and then left. It was a beautiful spring morning. I'm not sure if you need tickets other times of the year. But it was a fun quick activity.
Lincoln County Kansas Historical Museum,"216 W Lincoln Ave, Lincoln",Lincoln,5,20,39.0403999,-98.15022549999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Entry is by donation: make sure to put some change in their bin and buy some things in the gift shop area.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"

You could spend an hour just looking around and learning about how things were in the past in this town. For being a town under a 1,000 people this place has a heart of gold with a small town feel but a huge open arms feeling like many more."
