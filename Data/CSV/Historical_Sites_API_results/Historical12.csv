Battle of Punished Woman's Fork National Historic Site,"67871, Scott City",Scott City,4.8,73,38.6435538,-100.9279405,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was maybe the highlight of our trip. We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."

Butterfield Overland Despatch Trail Marker,Grinnell,Grinnell,5,2,38.7890678,-100.7629312,"point_of_interest, establishment","in the 1800s the Monument Rocks served as a landmark on the way to Denver, before roads, so this marker is for the Smokey Hill Trail for gold seekers in wagons on their way to Denver."
El Cuartelejo,Scott City,Scott City,4.5,4,38.6768293,-100.9148925,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a fascinating bit of history, connected with Native and Spanish interactions in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, from well before the Revolutionary War. The state park itself also has some really nice hiking/biking/horse trails and lots of camping, next to a scenic lake with fishing, swimming, and boating."
Monument Rocks,Oakley,Oakley,4.8,310,38.7954826,-100.7641158,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This place was pretty awesome.

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

Interesting fossils, history, nice people. Lovely gift shop. We loved the painted 1948 Suburban, and we were grateful for their clean little outhouse after we'd driven 90 minutes and spent another hour at Monument Rocks. Recommend stopping here, especially if you like rocks!"

Two shower/bathrooms are available. One with a separate women’s and men’s. I personally like the unisex facility as you have your own space with a lockable door.

This is a pretty little lake with a small area designated for swimming and two spots with playground equipment.

We have taken advantage of visiting Little Jerusalem Badlands and Monument Rocks.  So worth it.

We would definitely come back to this site."
