Historic Lecompton,"640 E Woodson Ave, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.7,132,39.0445903,-95.3921085,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",This museum is definitely worth your time for a nostalgic trip to the past. From the beautiful and historic Christmas tree displays to all of the artifacts from the wars and time gone past. This museum is a real gem.
Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, park, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."
Onaga Historical Society,"310 E 2nd St, Onaga",Onaga,4.9,7,39.4889827,-96.1659909,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Wonderful displays of local history, including a full-sized caboose, a one-room schoolhouse, and a settler's cabin. Marvelous way to spend an afternoon."
Constitution Hall State Historic Site,"319 Elmore St, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.6,107,39.0454091,-95.39473219999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",One of the best tours I've ever had. The period-costumed docent gave an inspiring 15 minute chat about the events that happened in Lecompton and its effect on the 1860 election and the history of the United States. The first floor has some well-designed displays.
Wamego Historical Museum,"406 4th St, Wamego",Wamego,4.7,30,39.2021295,-96.3004304,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The staff was so friendly and told us a lot about the items in the main room.  One of the volunteers opened all of the display building on site so we could see them (school house, store, cabin, etc)."
Old Jefferson Town,"703 Walnut St, Oskaloosa",Oskaloosa,4.5,10,39.21361419999999,-95.3095744,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Worth-the-drive destination.    Adults will love the beautifully-simple landscaping with the native grasses, split-rail fences and the views of prairie, lake and sky.   Kids could play forever in the old town setting.  Jefferson County saved a bunch of houses and businesses from the 1800s and early 1900s and moved them together to make a little town from the past.  Filmmakers should use this as a set.  The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.  Even if it's closed, you can still look inside the buildings to see what an old doctor's office or what the old grocery or hardware store had in it.  Plus there is a wonderful sculpture of a prairie wind wagon being swept up into a tornado.  I love it there."
Shawnee County Historical Society,"1118 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.7,3,39.0426068,-95.67216909999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Bob did a great job in teaching us. Heâ€™s very knowledgeable.
Nemaha County Historical Museum,"113 N 6th St, Seneca",Seneca,4.9,7,39.8361201,-96.0638549,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Very interesting! From the outside you'd never know the inside is full of all kinds of items from the past, some I've never seen before. Knowledgeable people inside to answer questions or give a tour. Enjoyed our visit."
Ward-Meade House,"3878+9V, Topeka",Topeka,4.5,2,39.0634196,-95.68266659999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Just beautiful and free.
Fort Titus,"640 E Woodson Ave, Lecompton",Lecompton,5,2,39.04431599999999,-95.39133059999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Nice little park detailing the history of the fort.
Jefferson County Historical Society,"703 Walnut St, Oskaloosa",Oskaloosa,4.4,9,39.21361419999999,-95.3095744,"museum, tourist_attraction, library, point_of_interest, establishment","For a small few building old west town it is simply AMAZING. The caretakers have put so much amazing museum worthy antiques into each building its worth coming to see.
Please find time to go see it if you are in the area!"
The vieux Crossing and the Miltary road,"19466-19886 Oregon Trail Rd, Wamego",Wamego,3,1,39.2564926,-96.2507483,"point_of_interest, establishment","Not quite sure what to make of this place, since there is barely anything here at all. There are two interesting historical markers describing the crossing and the military road, plus a pavilion over a single picnic table. Barely enough parking for a couple cars parked single file; since there's no room to turn around, you'll have to back up into the road. This place is also on the opposite side of the creek (and several dozen yards from) the Vieux family cemetery."
"The Lawrence sign, Lawrence, KS","Riverfront at, N 3rd St, Lawrence",Lawrence,5,3,38.9872185,-95.23337269999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you're a Supernatural fan, you definitely want to stop by!
Jensen Ackles took a picture there a few years before the end of the show ðŸ™Œ
It looks smaller on picture than it is in real life though, if you're trying to climb on it, it is really narrow but totally worth it! ðŸ’¯"
Wabaunsee County Historical Society & Museum,"227 Missouri Ave, Alma",Alma,4.7,13,39.0126409,-96.2896837,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great little museum of local history, covering Wabaunsee County from its frontier days. Lots and lots of exhibits spread out through the building.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building. Not sure if that might have affected the layout (the part with various historic washing machines seem to be rather crowded together, preventing a really good look). But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."
Oregon Trail Monument,"200 E Mission St, St Marys",St Marys,5,1,39.1910513,-96.06169840000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Amazing marker. Absolutely incredible that the Oregon Trail passed right through St. Marys. This monument was erected by Spanish-American War veterans.

Unfortunately, it is in a rather inconvenient location, sandwiched in between the railroad and a sometimes extremely busy US 24. Not really the easiest spot to get to."
Kansas Capital Dome,"300 SW 10th Ave, Topeka",Topeka,4.5,22,39.0478713,-95.678091,"point_of_interest, establishment","I have done a dome tour twice now in the past few months. The second time around we had a very knowledgeable tour guide who did a great job of informing us of many interesting facts about the capital building and dome. The architecture is very beautiful and the top gives great views of the city of Topeka below. If you are for some reason a tourist visiting Topeka this is probably one of the more interesting things to do in my opinion. If you have a fear of heights this is definitely not the activity for you, though the tour guide gave many opportunities for guests to return to the bottom without continuing to the top along the way. Additionally there are many steps to the top, thus unfortunately if you have mobility issues I also would not recommend this for you."
Topeka Pioneer Memorial Plaque,"4254-4298 SW Reinisch Pkwy, Topeka",Topeka,3,1,39.0548485,-95.7324902,"point_of_interest, establishment",Interesting boulder. Kind of wish they included more information about the original settlers of Topeka. Tried to find information about the Shawnee County Settlers Society but failed. Apparently it went out of existence at some point in the past but no idea why.
World War I Memorial Arch,"200 E Mission St, St Marys",St Marys,5,3,39.1912011,-96.06132079999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",The arch is next to a convent thus happened to stumble upon women of the cloth. A quite and meditative place to take a stroll on. A great site to lear more about the part St. Maryâ€™s played in the early stages our our history as well as religion.
Vieux Crossing Cemetery and Historical Marker,Louisville,Louisville,4.6,5,39.25588399999999,-96.246578,"point_of_interest, establishment",We found this spot while looking for an Oregon trail crossing. Interesting historical information hidden in Kansas.
