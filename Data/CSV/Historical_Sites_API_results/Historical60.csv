Kaw Mission State Historic Site,"500 North Msn, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,61,38.665916,-96.49394099999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped while traveling to stretch our legs on the walking path along the water. This historic site was in front of the parking area for walking. It was an interesting site that we weren't expecting. I don't think it was open that day, and I'm not certain it's a place you can enter. The buildings were nice to see, as well as the information posted near them, on the signs I shared here in my photos."
William Allen White Historic,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4.9,39,38.4096192,-96.1753485,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Wonderful tour! Loved all the artifacts that they had on display. Really made the tour kid friendly for our 4th graders!
Red Rocks State Historic Site,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4,25,38.4096136,-96.1753485,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","William Allen White's historic home called Red Rocks is an interesting place steeped in history. It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

I do believe that there could be more here, though: a trashcan, water spigot, a porta-john, etc. More people would definitely stop there if this were so."
Chase County Historical Society & Museum,"301 Broadway St, Cottonwood Falls",Cottonwood Falls,4.7,24,38.3718966,-96.5418717,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great place! The staff is wonderful, helpful and knows so much they can share. Anyone who loves history, antiques, and the like will love it. They have displays of everything from military history, letters, photos, art - you name it. Along with a great display honoring Coach Rockne, they have local yearbooks, and even a barb wire  display. I was able to find my grandfather's high school yearbook, photos, as well as pictures of my great grandfather and grandmother Mahlon and Rhoda hanging upstairs. I never knew he had a greenhouse in the town in the early 1900s

What a wonderful visit! I highly encourage anyone to check this place out, whether they have a local connection to it or not. It is a great town and 100% worth the diversion to spend some time here."
Lyon County History Center,"711 Commercial St, Emporia",Emporia,4.5,49,38.4066724,-96.1803561,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We visited for the playroom and exhibits.
We were very impressed with the play area: it seems like an enriching place for all ages.  There's a variety of activities, including magnet poetry, Legos, a play garden, shop, and house, and much more.
The exhibits are fun, but I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, I enjoy local history, and there's plenty here."
DAR Santa Fe Trail Crossing Monument,Council Grove,Council Grove,4.3,4,38.6528785,-96.57687349999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",There's enough of a pull off for a 26' RV to get in and turn around!  Historic monument that brings attention to what would otherwise be an overlooked spot on the Historic Santa Fe Trail.
Historic Florence Spring House,"Whitetail Rd, Florence",Florence,5,2,38.2656635,-96.9370203,"point_of_interest, establishment","The pump itself is dilapidated and is in desperate need of cosmetic repairs. This is the view from the area, though. Breathtaking!"
Former Missouri-Kansas-Texas Depot,"512 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,5,1,38.6618761,-96.4801873,"point_of_interest, establishment","This the new home for the Council Grove Visitor Center and the have lots of info for the area.
Plus it’s inside one of the last MKT railroad depots in Kansas! It is a great depot and I’m glad the city has taken it over and a rehab is hopefully coming!"
Council Oak,"106 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,4,5,38.6617658,-96.48464539999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","The Council Oak is the location where the treaty was signed between the Osage Native Americans and US Commissioners to give passage via the Santa Fe Trail.

The photos that are currently posted aren't really representative of the site. Yes, there is a monument that commemorates a particular unit in WWII, but that's not what the Council Oak location is about!

The Oak fell in a windstorm in the 1950's, and is now just a stump that is protected by a canopy.

Not to be confused with the 'Post Office Oak', which is nearby and is also a stump."

The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"
