We were pleased to see just about every campsite shaded with large trees. This also helped minimize the affects of a windy day. Designated swim area/sandy beach was perfect to hop in and beat the heat. Gradual slope into the water is perfect for your little ones.  With several campsites right on the water, it was easy to pick one to launch our kayaks. While we used a first come first serve tent site, it appeared most RV sites were booked. The restroom / shower facility appeared newer and was very well taken care of during our weekend trip. Staff and Ranger were friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend."
