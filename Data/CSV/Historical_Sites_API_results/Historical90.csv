Historic Adobe Museum,"300 E Oklahoma Ave, Ulysses",Ulysses,4.8,31,37.5770652,-101.3552232,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",A sudden change in weather forced us to cancel our distance travel plans so decided to make a short trip to visit this museum since we already had day together planned. Was well worth the 30 minute drive. An excellent museum that showcases the changes in the area over the past 150 years. The exhibits are well put together and organized for a visitor to have an educational tour as you wonder through the museum.  Much more to see than what you might expect for a small town. Admittance is free but consider leaving a donation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.
