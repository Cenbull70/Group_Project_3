Interesting piece of history along the Santa Fe trail.  You can walk to the top of a platform that is as high as the ""rock"" once was.  The view is pretty amazing.  Many names and initials (some very new) are carved into the rocks.  Cool historic spot."
B-29 Memorial Plaza,Great Bend,Great Bend,4.7,16,38.3472756,-98.84984709999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was a very informative and interesting memorial. I enjoyed it, but it was very sobering. Lots of history with a neat dedication to the men and women who have served in the armed forces."
Father Padilla Cross and Historic Marker,"1192 Ave M, Lyons",Lyons,4.6,18,38.3475135,-98.27654129999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","A mile north of historic Cow Creek Crossing on the Santa Fe Trail along highway 56 west of Lyon, Kansas."

Wish we had more time while here. Staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. Buildings are beautifully preserved/replicated.  There was a blacksmith on site when we visited, and he was very engaging with our family."
Buffalo Bill's Well on the Santa Fe Trail,"12th Rd, Lyons",Lyons,4,14,38.3338561,-98.27565560000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Unfortunately, the well is no more than a plate welded flush with the ground. It's a nice side trip off the main highway but there's nothing to see but a small sign with limited details. Wish there was more about the Santa Fe Trail crossing which was apparently important enough for someone to dig a well but those details aren't explained. It is a clean area for a quick leg stretch but not much else."
Boyd's Ranch Historical Marker,"S, Pawnee St, Larned",Larned,3.7,3,38.1732144,-99.16003549999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",When I stopped to read marker had 4 whitetail does standing around it and they were not spooked.

Barbed Wire Museum,"120 1st St, La Crosse",La Crosse,4.6,56,38.5246153,-99.311587,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great museum that’s kind of nondescript from the outside. You’ll see the two large balls of barbed wire.
Once inside it has multiple large rooms that are super carefully curated. There’s a nice woman that takes care of the museum and keep it super tidy.

They’ve everything from the history of the south west, to the uses of Barbed wire, how it was made, all the variations, and a room that’s a route 66 museum. There is art made with Barbed wire, all carefully displayed and very informative. This was one of the highlights of our route 66 trip.

It’s free but they take donations which will gladly left."
Bob Dole's Childhood Home,"1035 N Maple St, Russell",Russell,5,2,38.8957563,-98.8608065,"point_of_interest, establishment",Took a drive by the home. It is private residence so didn’t want to linger too long.  Interesting to see how people grew up.
1886 Stage Coach Mile Marker,Ellsworth,Ellsworth,5,1,38.7462563,-98.26256200000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great piece of history that people really don’t even consider anymore. If you’re in town, definitely worth a short drive to experience road travel & “technology” during the 1800’s."
Sunflower Coal,"415 27th St, Wilson",Wilson,4,3,38.8249243,-98.474255,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you’re into decaying symbols of a bygone time, this’ll be a good stop for you.  My kids and I got a kick out of walking along the railroads, imagining what might have come and gone around the Sunflower Coal buildings. Not to mention, the wide-open Kansas plains provide a breathtaking backdrop for this already photogenic site!

This landmark is only a short, easy drive from the highway. Pop on over if you’re looking to stretch your legs. It’s just one of several lovely cultural sites the town has to offer. You can also find a smattering of local mom-and-pop shops just a stone’s throw away."

The building needs demolished it has been for sale for years and is just being vandalized. Nothing of interest at this camp anymore, even the little red house has been moved."
Hodgen House Museum Complex,"104 S Main St, Ellsworth",Ellsworth,4.5,29,38.7282831,-98.23267109999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This museum was one complete surprise. I've walked the land around it and discovered all about why Ellsworth was a wicked town. The gun slingers, the cowboys, and even the ladies that kept them entertained. But once I stepped foot in the buildings and all the amazing things of the past, I realized this is a treasure that very few are taking advantage of. Take a step back in future and learn how creative those in the past were, plus come and see if you can connect with who ever  occupies the home. Come for a real adventure."

After the initial museum, don't forget to explore the outdoor exhibits.  Very informative window to the past."
