Greenwood County Historical Society,"120 W 4th St, Eureka",Eureka,5,2,37.8223962,-96.29519359999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Family members and I visited  this museum recently for the first time.  We were particularly interested in the Teterville oilfield area where my parents and sister lived.  The three volunteers who stayed late to help us were amazing representatives of both their craft and community.  Never have I experienced a more knowledgeable, helpful crew.  Thank you for all you did."
Teter Rock,"2555 300th, Eureka",Eureka,4.8,173,38.02956270000001,-96.42356370000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","Really enjoyed visiting Teeter Rock. The road to it is a long dusty country gravel road but is an enjoyable ride. The pathway up to the top of the hill where the rock is placed is long ( close to a mile) but my small 4x2 truck made it up effortlessly. I chose to drive very slowly since it’s not maintained in any way.

When we were there on Memorial Day weekend the wild mustangs were visible nearby."

Covered Rail Bridge New Albany KS,Fredonia,Fredonia,5,4,37.5822417,-95.9561293,"point_of_interest, establishment","This spot is gorgeous. I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."

Old Mill Dam,"Mill Dam Rd, Fredonia",Fredonia,4.6,42,37.5146161,-95.8491375,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Awesome old mill and dam. Very scenic. Road down to Fall River is very rough so parking at top of mill near water plant and walking down is probably a better choice if you don't have 4WD and more importantly high clearance.
