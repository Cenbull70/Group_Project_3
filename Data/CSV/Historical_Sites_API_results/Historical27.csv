* I just love that this exists in Google Maps, so I couldn‚Äôt resist reviewing it‚Ä¶:)"
Historic Phelps House,"1146 Grand Ave, Carthage",Carthage,4.7,67,37.1688686,-94.3089791,"lodging, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This place is an amazing venue for hosting a party!

Battle of Carthage State Historic Site,"1111 E Chestnut St, Carthage",Carthage,4.3,192,37.1737617,-94.2977805,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Easy to find historical site in the town of Carthage. I visited in December so had no issues with bugs as others reported.  The trail goes up by the spring and crosses over the top of rock outcroppings. Pretty walk. Easy enough for families but would advise that there are no railings for safety if you have very small children. It loops back across the lawn, and depending on water flow, you may have to contend with a wet crossing at the far end. The site was not trashed up, but there are no trash cans, so pack out trash to preserve the beauty. There are also no facilities of any kind but a couple of picnic tables that would be shady in the summer.  The open lawn might be a fun spot for a game of frisbee though!"

Beware of the large graffiti stone post. There are wasps living around there! Either way, fine to take a pic from afar. I‚Äôm not sure that the graffiti stone wall is of any significance? I think the plaque is the actual border line."
Joplin History & Mineral Museum,"504 S Schifferdecker Ave, Joplin",Joplin,4.6,324,37.0876836,-94.5506661,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Pretty cool spot if you are into rocks or local mining culture.

You can't go inside the home, but you can see in the windows. I would suggest that if you stop by, make sure it's a nicer day and not too soggy/rainy if you want to walk around the home. A quick stop just off the highway."
Joplin Union Depot,"205 N Main St Rd, Joplin",Joplin,4.5,31,37.0915785,-94.5121477,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because it's a good place to get interesting pictures, however it's not getting 5 because the place was poorly maintained and is at this point an abandoned building that the city won't get rid of or repair. It leaves a bad impression of downtown and the city as a whole to new travelers or potential new residents and I believe the place should either be demolished or repaired as a museum, a trendy restaurant, or an arts gallery or something. Anything is better than the abandoned building that's there now."
