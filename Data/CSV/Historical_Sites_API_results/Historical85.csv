The three volunteers who stayed late to help us were amazing representatives of both their craft and community.  Never have I experienced a more knowledgeable, helpful crew.  Thank you for all you did."

Covered Rail Bridge New Albany KS,Fredonia,Fredonia,5,4,37.5822417,-95.9561293,"point_of_interest, establishment","This spot is gorgeous. I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."
