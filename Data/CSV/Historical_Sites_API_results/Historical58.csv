Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.73800519999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"

There is much more to Carry Nation and her campaigns then I ever knew. This is the place to visit if you're interested in that time of American history and culture!"

Although the sign in front and Google maps say that íts hours of operation start from 10:30am on Saturdays, it was closed the first time I came (11am ""ish"") with a sign saying something in the lines of ""we'll come back soon"" so I visited again at noon, same sign there, same situation so I continued my way to Oklahoma. Was pitiful because I came all the way from Central Kansas. Maybe I can give a better review in the future if I find it open."

Love the ehibition and there’s always some new artwork and wonder to behold. It’s a small vibrant museum with a nice selection of local and nationally renowned artists.

The space, modern and essential, is very elegant."
