I was actually intrigued by the history, unexpected gem in the city"

The trail was well maintained and the bathroom was also well maintained.  Check out my instagram post on this site: @mikeisoutside"
Raytown Historical Society & Museum,"9705 E 63rd St, Raytown",Raytown,4.7,16,39.0084644,-94.4668538,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",I haven‚Äôt been yet so this is more of a question than a review. I was just wondering if the place is haunted. I gave it 3 stars because..why not
Monticello Community Historical Society,"23860 W 83rd St, Shawnee",Shawnee,4.3,10,38.97801,-94.862608,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Very small place with a focus on only one man who had a connection with Buffalo Bill Cody. It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."
Overland Park Historical Society,"7319 W 79th St, Overland Park",Overland Park,4.9,7,38.9856332,-94.6705746,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We visited both the HQ for the OPHS but also the exhibit space shared with the Johnson County Museum in the former King Louie Bowl. The HQ has a a few posters and books for sale but most of the historical material is in the larger space on Metcalf.  There you will find exhibits showing much of the retail history of Overland Park with material from the Metcalf South Shopping Center.   Brad Moore's excellent models bring life back to the White Haven Motel, and several restaurants including he Charlie Chan Restaurant where Brad worked as a teenager in High School.  The OPHS exhibit is a bargain at ""Free"" while the downstairs Johnson County exhibit has a small admission charge. Both are worthwhile and additive  - allow about two hours for the pair."

Wildcat Woods,"7601 Prospect Ave, Kansas City",Kansas City,5,1,38.9890435,-94.55320909999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","Cool find for anyone who likes old anusement parks. Footers of the Wildcat coaster from Fairyland Park remain all these years later. That said, it makes me question how much of the structural steel was actually relocated to Frontier City."
A Day On The Trail Historical Marker,Overland Park,Overland Park,5,2,38.9840857,-94.6718358,"point_of_interest, establishment",Very interesting historical marker at the corner of  Santa Fe and 80th. Includes a stone marker and two informational displays.

The exhibition is a must see as it showcases wide variety of miniature paintings from all over the world. The Museum on its own is well curated with various artifacts associated with local and Kansas history. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and answered every question with immense patience. Hidden jewel for history buffs."
Asylum Bridge,Osawatomie,Osawatomie,4.6,35,38.50516349999999,-94.941989,"point_of_interest, establishment","Absolutely beautiful, stunning, kind of falling apart, but mother nature is not a force to be reckoned with. heh I love visiting famous and historic old bridges and I was quite shocked to not see any ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù sign on the entrance to the bridge, it is gated, but maybe that‚Äôs just for safety concern?. I wasn‚Äôt about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. üòÖ

I‚Äôm from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it‚Äôs been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don‚Äôt want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a new piece of Kansas history and it‚Äôs well worth a visit!

This is public property, so NONE of the questions below are relevant."
Pottawatomie Massacre,Lane,Lane,4.2,17,38.4394078,-95.0840813,"point_of_interest, establishment",It is very cool to see this marker and know the history that happened on this spot. But what was even cooler was playing on the old dangerous playground equipment that resides there now.
Dietrich Cabin,"City Park, Ottawa",Ottawa,4.3,15,38.6106064,-95.26795109999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",Visited a few months ago and only saw the outside.

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!

We'll there is a gravel parking area and stairs down to the water but the water was high when we were there and it would have been dangerous to swim. There is a small dam just before the bridge but be careful of the reverse current.
