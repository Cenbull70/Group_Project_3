Onaga Historical Society,"310 E 2nd St, Onaga",Onaga,4.9,7,39.4889827,-96.1659909,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Wonderful displays of local history, including a full-sized caboose, a one-room schoolhouse, and a settler's cabin. Marvelous way to spend an afternoon."
Historical Hand-Dug Well,"401 Road to Oz Highway, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,15,39.3962435,-96.4080357,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's amazing to read about it and to think it was hand dug. It was just sad to see that people thought it was a trashcan of some sort.... no, not the algae because that's going to be a thing in any still water situation. The plastic jugs, the shoes and other garbage floating. It's sad....but it's in a beautiful park area."
Nemaha County Historical Museum,"113 N 6th St, Seneca",Seneca,4.9,7,39.8361201,-96.0638549,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Very interesting! From the outside you'd never know the inside is full of all kinds of items from the past, some I've never seen before. Knowledgeable people inside to answer questions or give a tour. Enjoyed our visit."

Historic Trails Park & Rope Ferry Replica,"1189 US-77, Marysville",Marysville,3.9,11,39.84325159999999,-96.6592611,"point_of_interest, establishment","A little bit obtuse to get to this place but definitely worth a visit if you just want to see an historical place. It's all outdoors with a couple of markers and some info. Our visit, June 23, was during the time trees are completely leafed out so even though the river wasn't that far away, we couldn't begin to see it from where we were. There were some trails leading back into the woods, but we decided they were a little too narrow and semi overgrown to feel comfortable about picking up critters like ticks. Good place to use your imagination!"
Washington County Historical,"216 Ballard St, Washington",Washington,3.7,3,39.8177782,-97.04968869999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",This is a cool place with a wealth of knowledge of what it was like to live in rural Kansas in days gone by
The California-Oregon Trail Historical Marker,Westmoreland,Westmoreland,4.4,5,39.3812527,-96.4051985,"point_of_interest, establishment","This was a nice surprise finding the rest/picnic stop along our route on our way to Pawnee SRA.  It was an easy off and on from the road, and plenty of parking for our rig.  Across the road was the rest of the rest stop but perhaps too small for us to get in and out of the space with our rig.  But it was cool to read the description of this route and how for the period notes it was a regular route to California/Oregon via the wagon trail.  Good history.  The area could use a bit of maintenance but otherwise safe and clean"
Table Rock Historical Museum,"414 Houston St, Table Rock",Table Rock,4.8,6,40.1790452,-96.09640259999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Saw this wonderful old opera house being rediscovered and promoted by the robust local historical society.

Carnahan Church,Olsburg,Olsburg,4.7,13,39.3366633,-96.6261172,"point_of_interest, establishment",Church itself gave off a bad vibe. Something followed us home until we realized and told it it's not welcome. Deer almost made us poop our pants when running through the graveyard.
Rock Creek Valley Historical Society,"507 Burkman St, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,3,39.3911853,-96.4106113,"point_of_interest, establishment","While it is a rather small history museum, it is still pretty awesome, with great displays of local history, like a doctor's office and a one room schoolhouse. On the downside, not all of the displays were labelled, and on my visit, I was guided around by a volunteer who didn't know the story of all the displays. Personally, I would have liked to have been able to walk around on my own a bit."
Oregon Trail gravesite,"9HMV+F6, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,5,1,39.3836633,-96.4069085,"point_of_interest, establishment",Amazing historical site. Incredible to think that this person was passing through this area in the 1840s on the way to Oregon.
