Haystack Mound,"R3F9+VM, Brookville",Brookville,5,2,38.824631,-97.9308,"point_of_interest, establishment","Another ancient Native American spiritual mound. This one is a precise conical mound shaped like a stack of strewn hay, hence the name given to this West Saline County natural & artificially man-made by a previous indigenous culture that spanned this area, predominantly Ellsworth and Rice Counties just to the West  and South Southwest of this mound. Nearby Native American mounds that are also nearby are the
•TWIN MOUNDS- in NW Saline Co. (Glendale)

•NORTH POLE MOUND- on the Northern Saline and SouthOttawa Co. line

•IRON MOUND-a few miles east of Salina is a platform Mound that looks just like Monk's Mound in Cahokia

•SOLDIER'S CAP MOUND- a tabletop Mound on the Smoky Hill Weapons Range

•TWIN MOUNDS- near Roxbury in Northern McPherson and SE Saline County.

•CORONADO HEIGHTS- Yep, even Coronado Heights was an ancient Mound that the WPA built a castle on top of in the 1930's proclaiming Francisco Coronado was here. (In truth, this is wrong it was actually SSW of Lindsborg somewhere closer to Lyons or Little River, Kansas area)."
South Fork Spillman Creek Double Arch Bridge,"KS-181, Sylvan Grove",Sylvan Grove,4.6,14,39.14066469999999,-98.3966433,"point_of_interest, establishment","Cool, early century all local rock double arch bridge.

Geodetic Center of North America,Tipton,Tipton,3,8,39.224087,-98.542152,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF ALL SOCIETY IS A BRONZE PLATE MARKS THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOT ON THIS CONTINENT TO SURVEYORS AND MAP MAKERS. ENGRAVED IN THE BRONZE IS A CROSS-MARK AND ON THE TINY POINT WHERE THE LINES CROSS DEPEND THE SURVEYS OF A SIXTH OF THE WORLDS SURFACE. THIS IS THE GEODETIC CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES, THE ""PRIMARY STATION"" FOR ALL NORTH AMERICAN SURVEYS.

IT WAS LOCATED IN 1901 BY THE U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. LATER CANADA AND MEXICO ADOPTED THE POINT AND ITS SUPPORTING SYSTEM AS THE BASE FOR THEIR SURVEYS AND IT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE ""NORTH AMERICAN DATUM."" WHAT GREENWICH IS TO THE LONGITUDE OF THE WORLD, THEREFORE, A KANSAS PASTURE IS TO THE LINES AND BOUNDARIES OF THIS CONTINENT.

IT MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC CENTER OF THE U. S. WHICH IS 42 MILES NORTH, IN SMITH COUNTY."
Bohemian Hall,Glasco,Glasco,4.7,7,39.2630639,-97.9111585,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's not a restaurant. It's a Hall in the country with very little around. It's a great place, but there's no air conditioning."
Twin Mounds,"R45X+W6, Brookville",Brookville,5,1,38.8098712,-97.8519902,"point_of_interest, establishment",

Lincoln County Kansas Historical Museum,"216 W Lincoln Ave, Lincoln",Lincoln,5,20,39.0403999,-98.15022549999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Entry is by donation: make sure to put some change in their bin and buy some things in the gift shop area.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"

Coronado Heights Castle,"Walking Trail, Falun",Falun,4.7,1488,38.6129915,-97.70321709999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Very cool spot to visit. Was looking for interesting spots not super far off I-70 on my way to Colorado and this was a very good choice.

Amazing views, at least for midwest standards. 10 little cook pits? Ring the area with big stone fireplaces and tables, another massive central fireplace with two big tables, vault toilets, and the Castle itself. Very much worth the visit"
Fossett Plaza,"2035 Beechcraft Rd, Salina",Salina,5,7,38.7948981,-97.6420682,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you're an avation buff or want a great place to relax, this is a nice little area to check out. A nice monument showing the historic flight of Steve Fosset around the world in February of 2005. There are plenty of benches for sitting near the tarmac.  It's a cool place to watch aircraft coming and going. This place gets busy whenever the Jaded Thunder comes to town. I Love this spot."
White Cross Hill,Smolan,Smolan,3.7,3,38.6669565,-97.691632,"point_of_interest, establishment",Why is this even listed. It’s private property and not open for access.
1886 Stage Coach Mile Marker,Ellsworth,Ellsworth,5,1,38.7462563,-98.26256200000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great piece of history that people really don’t even consider anymore. If you’re in town, definitely worth a short drive to experience road travel & “technology” during the 1800’s."
Sunflower Coal,"415 27th St, Wilson",Wilson,4,3,38.8249243,-98.474255,"point_of_interest, establishment","If you’re into decaying symbols of a bygone time, this’ll be a good stop for you.  My kids and I got a kick out of walking along the railroads, imagining what might have come and gone around the Sunflower Coal buildings. Not to mention, the wide-open Kansas plains provide a breathtaking backdrop for this already photogenic site!

This landmark is only a short, easy drive from the highway. Pop on over if you’re looking to stretch your legs. It’s just one of several lovely cultural sites the town has to offer. You can also find a smattering of local mom-and-pop shops just a stone’s throw away."
