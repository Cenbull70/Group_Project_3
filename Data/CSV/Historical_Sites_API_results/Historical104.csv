Harvey County Historical Society,"203 N Main St, Newton",Newton,4.8,16,38.0442092,-97.345556,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",I have so much Respect for the Harvey County Historical Society.  We as a community of Harvey County are blessed to have them. We have no future without reminders of our past.  I'm very grateful to have been a part of the reenactment!
Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum,"204 S Main St, Wichita",Wichita,4.7,241,37.6847302,-97.33786979999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, park, art_gallery, point_of_interest, store, establishment","Well- worth one's time!  This gem of a local museum dedicated to the history of the Wichita and its environs in Sedgwick County is well worth the effort to explore.  The volunteer staff is friendly, intelligent, and helpful, the museum store is ideal with many small gifts to select from, and the parking is easy on a weekend (I went on a Sunday afternoon when the downtown area was largely uninhabited.) As another reviewer commented, the museum is definitely geared toward adults, and I concur. However, children might be engaged for an hour or so exploring the classically restored building and viewing items from previous generations. The building has been magnificently restored to its original stately bearing, which in and of itself makes a visit worth one's time and effort. Don't forget to leave a donation if you can as this non-profit museum is well worth preserving for future generations."
Delano Clock Tower,Wichita,Wichita,4.5,22,37.6840349,-97.346959,"point_of_interest, establishment","Ok, I'm not sure why I am being hit up to rate the clock tower at the Douglas roundabout, but ok, here goes... It's a clock, it's always had the right time on it on my way by, it's nice looking and definitely compliments the area in my humble opinion. I hope Google's happy, they goaded me into reviewing a clock."
Chisholm Trail Marker,"199 McLean Blvd, Wichita",Wichita,4.7,12,37.6854689,-97.34463799999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Too cool! Fairly non-descript marker erected in 1941 that celebrates the Chisolm Trail and all the beef and goods that flowed towards the west.
Towanda Kansas Historical Marker,"Q288+3G, Towanda",Towanda,4.2,10,37.765154,-96.98370779999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","No TP menâ€™s room in none of the 9 stalls. Also, toilet  seats loose slide all over the place. Also, they have not clean the inside of the stall or door walls and what looks like a year worth of unfortunately spittle. They need to take a garden hose and wash all walls down. And use soap not just water to wash all the stall walls."

My family visited for the annual tea party and it was exquisite!! I would have paid 2x the price for the tickets for an extra 30 minutes.   ðŸ¤£ so my only complaint about that event was that I couldn't sit there all day and enjoy the wonderful ambiance they created. It is truly a special event. We look forward to going  back to thoroughly explore the museum."

Old Mill Plaza,"301 N Main St, Newton",Newton,4.8,13,38.0452683,-97.34526380000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","I recently dined here and was thoroughly impressed with the culinary experience. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned, offering a delightful burst of flavor with each bite. The truffle mac and cheese was a true highlight, rich and creamy with the perfect hint of truffle. To top it off, the pork chops were tender and juicy. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the service was exceptional.
