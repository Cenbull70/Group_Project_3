Whee Hill,"699 Oak St, Carthage",Carthage,4.8,35,37.1764696,-94.3183486,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a historical bridge that is rumored to be replaced, with no concise date for replacement. Therefore, if you‚Äôre in the area, and want your drop your stomach, give it a good run and go for it! If you‚Äôre traveling in the pictured direction, you‚Äôll get a nice view of the Jasper County Courthouse.
* I just love that this exists in Google Maps, so I couldn‚Äôt resist reviewing it‚Ä¶:)"
Historic Phelps House,"1146 Grand Ave, Carthage",Carthage,4.7,67,37.1688686,-94.3089791,"lodging, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This place is an amazing venue for hosting a party! They had absolutely everything we needed. Having beautiful dishes to eat from and serving dishes made the party so elegant.

Murphysburg National Historic District,"625 S Sergeant Ave, Joplin",Joplin,5,1,37.0845908,-94.5199916,"point_of_interest, establishment",
Battle of Carthage State Historic Site,"1111 E Chestnut St, Carthage",Carthage,4.3,192,37.1737617,-94.2977805,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Easy to find historical site in the town of Carthage. I visited in December so had no issues with bugs as others reported.  The trail goes up by the spring and crosses over the top of rock outcroppings. Pretty walk. Easy enough for families but would advise that there are no railings for safety if you have very small children. It loops back across the lawn, and depending on water flow, you may have to contend with a wet crossing at the far end. The site was not trashed up, but there are no trash cans, so pack out trash to preserve the beauty. There are also no facilities of any kind but a couple of picnic tables that would be shady in the summer.  The open lawn might be a fun spot for a game of frisbee though!"
Main and Eighth Streets Historic District,"833 S Main St, Joplin",Joplin,5,1,37.0815044,-94.51360389999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",

I happen to like both. Dino exhibit has moved on for now sadly. Glad we got to see it before the donor recalled it.
Joplin Union Depot,"205 N Main St Rd, Joplin",Joplin,4.5,31,37.0915785,-94.5121477,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because it's a good place to get interesting pictures, however it's not getting 5 because the place was poorly maintained and is at this point an abandoned building that the city won't get rid of or repair. It leaves a bad impression of downtown and the city as a whole to new travelers or potential new residents and I believe the place should either be demolished or repaired as a museum, a trendy restaurant, or an arts gallery or something. Anything is better than the abandoned building that's there now."

The Humboldt Thunderbolt,"QH3M+HW, Humboldt",Humboldt,5,2,37.753943,-95.41522599999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","A fitting tribute to a local baseball legend, and part of a town's economic revival.
