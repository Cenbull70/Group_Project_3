Fort Hays State Historic Site,"1472 US Highway 183 Alt, Hays",Hays,4.6,222,38.862995,-99.341484,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great place to see how the old forts were laid out during the westward expansion. They have been able to preserve two of the officers' homes and the enlisted men's barracks. The foundations are shown for the commanding officer's home that was sadly sold and moved away. Even the officer's outhouse is there!

The museum part of the visitor center is well done, and the short movies are well done. They have dealt with culturally sensitive topics, too.

I highly recommend seeing this site if you are traveling through or if you live there. Great for all ages."

Barbed Wire Museum,"120 1st St, La Crosse",La Crosse,4.6,56,38.5246153,-99.311587,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great museum that’s kind of nondescript from the outside. You’ll see the two large balls of barbed wire.
Once inside it has multiple large rooms that are super carefully curated. There’s a nice woman that takes care of the museum and keep it super tidy.

They’ve everything from the history of the south west, to the uses of Barbed wire, how it was made, all the variations, and a room that’s a route 66 museum. There is art made with Barbed wire, all carefully displayed and very informative. This was one of the highlights of our route 66 trip.

It’s free but they take donations which will gladly left."

Frontier Historical Park,"Old Hwy 40, Hays",Hays,4.6,336,38.8637386,-99.3389522,"park, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped at Frontier Historical Park to specifically see the bison, notably the ‘ghost buffalo,’ Ghostbuster. We were surprised to see/learn that Ghostbuster was brought in many years ago, and there is a brand new, unadvertised even more white baby bison who joined the herd. We were lucky that the bison were all hanging near the fence at the southeast corner of their pasture, and we could get great views and photos. Definitely worth a stop! We didn’t check out the rest of the park, but it’s looks beautiful and has a well-maintained disc golf course."

Sternberg Museum of Natural History,"3000 Sternberg Dr, Hays",Hays,4.7,726,38.8890706,-99.2997841,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We had such a great experience overall. The museum is super clean and easy to navigate. They have a variety of things on display from mineral and fossils to live animals and interactive activities. We throughly enjoyed the dinosaurs on display now and my daughter had a great time in the discovery center.

I work with reptiles professionally, venomous snakes specifically, and was thrilled to see an exhibit a about rattlesnakes. I enjoyed the spread of North American species on display. Lots of nice information was available on the boards to read. The enclosures of the rattlesnakes (and other herps throughout the museum) are smaller for some species than I'd prefer but I understand that space is limited and all of the enclosures were clean with various textures, hiding, climbing, and visually appealing decor so it appears that they want to do as well for the animals as they can. A couple of rattlesnakes and the boa were quite overweight though so I'd love to see them again a little bit slimmed down. Regardless, I would absolutely visit again."

Hard to imagine nothing there except the cemetery 100+ years ago. Makes you wonder how many people are still buried in the yards of the neighborhood today.
