It's a stunning home with great ghostly stories as told by Bill, the amazing owner of the home.  Not only did Bill provide great stories about the home, and ""spirited"" contents of the home, but he was incredibly kind in creating a sweet surprise for a special birthday in our group, and helping us find other resources in the area to make our stay in Atchison unforgettable!  His stories about the house, his fascinating raven, and especially the sharing of cherished memories of his beloved son, Rocky, created an atmosphere of vibrant life and intrigue in what would otherwise be a very spooky place!!  Don't miss the creepy pandemic room in the attic, and if you go in the basement ... well ... good luck!!!  We will be visiting Ravenhearse as many times as we can, and hope to see our new friend Bill at Ravenhearse the next time we come to Atchison!!"
