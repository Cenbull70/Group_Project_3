It is just unfortunate that it took me so long to visit. As someone who only lived in the area for a short time, I highly suggest coming here to grasp a piece of the history that sorrounds the Geary County communities."
Kaw Mission State Historic Site,"500 North Msn, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,61,38.665916,-96.49394099999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped while traveling to stretch our legs on the walking path along the water. This historic site was in front of the parking area for walking. It was an interesting site that we weren't expecting. I don't think it was open that day, and I'm not certain it's a place you can enter. The buildings were nice to see, as well as the information posted near them, on the signs I shared here in my photos."

Allegawaho Memorial Heritage Park,"S 525 Rd, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.3,20,38.6257382,-96.4315409,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","I came here on a whim and it really surprised me. The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"

Historical Hand-Dug Well,"401 Road to Oz Highway, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,15,39.3962435,-96.4080357,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's amazing to read about it and to think it was hand dug. It was just sad to see that people thought it was a trashcan of some sort.... no, not the algae because that's going to be a thing in any still water situation. The plastic jugs, the shoes and other garbage floating. It's sad....but it's in a beautiful park area."

Pioneer Jail,"507 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,13,38.6618794,-96.4807063,"point_of_interest, establishment","Not much to it but it looks authentic. You can go inside the front ""lobby"" and see inside the two jail cells. Pretty sparse!"

There are several neat museums on Fort Riley. I would’ve given it five stars if not for the background check required to enter the base. You will not be allowed to enter without providing a picture ID, Social Security number and fingerprints."

There are two interesting historical markers describing the crossing and the military road, plus a pavilion over a single picnic table. Barely enough parking for a couple cars parked single file; since there's no room to turn around, you'll have to back up into the road. This place is also on the opposite side of the creek (and several dozen yards from) the Vieux family cemetery."
Wabaunsee County Historical Society & Museum,"227 Missouri Ave, Alma",Alma,4.7,13,39.0126409,-96.2896837,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great little museum of local history, covering Wabaunsee County from its frontier days. Lots and lots of exhibits spread out through the building.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building. Not sure if that might have affected the layout (the part with various historic washing machines seem to be rather crowded together, preventing a really good look). But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."
