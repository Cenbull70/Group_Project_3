Since Salina was founded primarily around Iron Ave & Santa Fe, more precisely (Iron Ave & 5th St), which on the SW corner where Carol Lee Donuts is now used to sit the first dwelling ever built in Salina in the year 1858. That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South. Also, anything that sits E of Santa Fe Ave is East in the address, and vice-versa anything W of Santa Fe Ave is West. For instance Salina Community Theater is 303 East Iron and the Smoky Hill Museum is 211 West Iron.]"
