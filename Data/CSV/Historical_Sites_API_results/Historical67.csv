Buffalo Bill's Well on the Santa Fe Trail,"12th Rd, Lyons",Lyons,4,14,38.3338561,-98.27565560000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Unfortunately, the well is no more than a plate welded flush with the ground. It's a nice side trip off the main highway but there's nothing to see but a small sign with limited details. Wish there was more about the Santa Fe Trail crossing which was apparently important enough for someone to dig a well but those details aren't explained. It is a clean area for a quick leg stretch but not much else."

Amazing views, at least for midwest standards. 10 little cook pits? Ring the area with big stone fireplaces and tables, another massive central fireplace with two big tables, vault toilets, and the Castle itself. Very much worth the visit"

I've walked the land around it and discovered all about why Ellsworth was a wicked town. The gun slingers, the cowboys, and even the ladies that kept them entertained. But once I stepped foot in the buildings and all the amazing things of the past, I realized this is a treasure that very few are taking advantage of. Take a step back in future and learn how creative those in the past were, plus come and see if you can connect with who ever  occupies the home. Come for a real adventure."
