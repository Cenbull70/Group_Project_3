I loved that you got to tour the basement and ballroom, as well as the main rooms. It was a very in-depth tour with a great guide. There's plenty of parking, be there about 10 min before the start time. Don't be late, they're very punctual with the start time and its a singular volunteer so the doors lock once the tour starts. If you are there early, like we were, you can take the time to walk the grounds and check out the garden/yard and the info boards with historical information. They have a small gift area and sell things like t-shirts, salt water taffy, and bottles of water. The tour takes about an hour. You can buy this as a combo ticket that also includes the Dalton Museum. Beautiful home with a lot of surprising tech advancements and original items. Kids 11 & 14 enjoyed the tour as well. There are stairs you'll have to do, but there are handrails to utilize and the older members in the group seemed to handle it fine. Check this place out!"
