Historic Adobe Museum,"300 E Oklahoma Ave, Ulysses",Ulysses,4.8,31,37.5770652,-101.3552232,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",A sudden change in weather forced us to cancel our distance travel plans so decided to make a short trip to visit this museum since we already had day together planned. Was well worth the 30 minute drive. An excellent museum that showcases the changes in the area over the past 150 years. The exhibits are well put together and organized for a visitor to have an educational tour as you wonder through the museum.  Much more to see than what you might expect for a small town. Admittance is free but consider leaving a donation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.
Amache National Historic Site,"County Rd 23 5/10, Granada",Granada,4.5,115,38.056303,-102.329192,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Amache is the newest national historic site (as of June 2024). Additionally, it was one of 10 sites used as Japanese internment camps during World War 2. It is a little bare as it was run mostly by volunteers prior to becoming a nps site. However, you can drive through, but it is mostly just building foundations. You can tell that they are continuing to rebuild. Be aware that it is a dirt road through the site and there are no rangers working or bathrooms available at this time."

Stanton County Museum,"104 E Highland Ave, Johnson City",Johnson City,4.9,15,37.5633303,-101.7496836,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","A small museum. Has lots of local history. It's not like a big city museum but I really enjoyed it!!! I love the local history and pics...etc. Kind of takes you back to another time! The girl there, attendant, was very nice! There was not a fee to get in but there is a donation box (we left donations as we had planned to pay to get in anyway)."
Kearny County Museum,"111 S Buffalo St, Lakin",Lakin,4.7,13,37.9385003,-101.2566896,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Free exhibit of many items related to the origin and founding of the county. As well as exhibits of everyday life from the founding to the present. Pioneer life, bones of mammoths, native Americans, and local service people are just examples. So much to see. Please remember to give a donation."
Signature Block,"2MWG+XW, Granada",Granada,4,2,38.0474521,-102.3226355,"point_of_interest, establishment","Very interesting place to visit. Not sure I'd say so interesting that I'd make a trip here from a place like Denver only for this...but if you happen to be in the area I would absolutely stop by. Good signage to learn about the camp. They have restored many of the buildings. Good to learn about our past, so we (hopefully) don't make the same mistakes in the future."
Amache Museum,"205 E Goff Ave, Granada",Granada,4.7,77,38.0625626,-102.3087662,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a free museum to visit and experience. Parking is also free in the neighboring bank lot or on the side street. As of May 2024 you can also find the national park passport stamp here just inside the main entry door on the left. There are free restrooms here, too. The exhibits are really extensive, plus they feature many donated items from actual internment camp inmates. It's a great look at a terrible decision in our country's history. The only major downside is no staff was inside the museum to ask questions to or welcome us in."
Grant County Museum,"300 E Oklahoma Ave, Ulysses",Ulysses,4.8,6,37.5769426,-101.3552174,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","The people here know their history. I've seen buses from other towns taking their kids through the museum. It's a great experience for all ages. Well worth your time to stop in and take a look.

I personally was interested in the arrowhead and sharks teeth displays."

I walked up to the highway hoping for better but I got better pictures while in the moving vehicle"
