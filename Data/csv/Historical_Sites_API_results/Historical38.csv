Battle of Punished Woman's Fork National Historic Site,"67871, Scott City",Scott City,4.8,73,38.6435538,-100.9279405,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was maybe the highlight of our trip. We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."
Little Pyramids,"Elk, Oakley",Oakley,4.2,18,38.7566683,-100.9486703,"point_of_interest, establishment",These formations look amazing during the golden hour in the morning. The birds nesting on the formations are super active. Great little pull over on the way to the badlands

The ladies there are so willing to share information. We will go again!
Scott County Veteran Memorial,"415 E 5th St, Scott City",Scott City,5,3,38.4821635,-100.9021606,"point_of_interest, establishment",A nice memorial that is well done and touching. Lots of community support shows here.
Butterfield Overland Despatch Trail Marker,Grinnell,Grinnell,5,2,38.7890678,-100.7629312,"point_of_interest, establishment","in the 1800s the Monument Rocks served as a landmark on the way to Denver, before roads, so this marker is for the Smokey Hill Trail for gold seekers in wagons on their way to Denver."
El Cuartelejo,Scott City,Scott City,4.5,4,38.6768293,-100.9148925,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a fascinating bit of history, connected with Native and Spanish interactions in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, from well before the Revolutionary War. The state park itself also has some really nice hiking/biking/horse trails and lots of camping, next to a scenic lake with fishing, swimming, and boating."
Museum of the Great Plains,"401 S 4th St, Leoti",Leoti,4.9,14,38.4827597,-101.3581745,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Such a great museum, so many rooms and displays are set up very well. A lot of work went into each area. There's a basement too!"
Monument Rocks,Oakley,Oakley,4.8,310,38.7954826,-100.7641158,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This place was pretty awesome.

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."
Butterfield Trail Museum,"515 Hilts Ave, Russell Springs",Russell Springs,4.7,14,38.9123597,-101.1804207,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",Excellent collection of history for the area. Gorgeous old courthouse! Well worth the stop!

A tremendous place to learn about Pueblan history that was surprising to find in this part of the country."

Interesting fossils, history, nice people. Lovely gift shop. We loved the painted 1948 Suburban, and we were grateful for their clean little outhouse after we'd driven 90 minutes and spent another hour at Monument Rocks. Recommend stopping here, especially if you like rocks!"
Historic Lake Scott State Park,"101 W Scott Lake Dr, Scott City",Scott City,4.5,382,38.6853256,-100.9252166,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","We are staying in the Circle Drive Campground with electricity and water. Dump site available down the road.

Two shower/bathrooms are available. One with a separate women’s and men’s. I personally like the unisex facility as you have your own space with a lockable door.

This is a pretty little lake with a small area designated for swimming and two spots with playground equipment.

We have taken advantage of visiting Little Jerusalem Badlands and Monument Rocks.  So worth it.

We would definitely come back to this site."

Monument Rocks Natural Landmark,Scott City,Scott City,4.8,291,38.794158,-100.7631291,"point_of_interest, establishment",Absolutely worth the trip! Do it! Good amount of gravel road driving but nothing that can’t be tackled in a sedan or mini van. One of the coolest things I’ve seen in Kansas! Highly recommend! I recommend bringing water and snacks!
Bellwether Barn,"10411 KS-95, Scott City",Scott City,4.3,36,38.6308898,-100.9140625,"point_of_interest, establishment","We attended a wedding in August. Temperature was in the high 90s, and typical of Kansas, quite windy. The ceremony was outside, so we sat for longer than an hour in the hot sun, and dealing with wind. During the meal, we spent more effort fighting flies than we did eating. The entire day was utterly miserable. It seems foolish to build a venue that is supposed to be elegant, and not install air conditioning. Most weddings are in the summer; this place is not suitable for a summer wedding. The terrain getting from the parking area to the barn is a bit rugged, which is a problem for people who are not sure-footed. Only one toilet in the ladies room was working, so the line was very long. The rest room is located in a tight corner where it became ridiculously congested.

The staff was courteous."
