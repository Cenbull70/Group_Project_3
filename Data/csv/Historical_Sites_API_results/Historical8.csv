The gentleman there was extremely knowledgeable and provided us a great tour of the building and the artifacts displayed there. We purchased an Oral History Book that was published in 1998 of folks who had grown up in the area which we found very interesting. The visit to both Goodland and St Francis was  so nice and we were very glad we ventured off the Interstate to explore these friendly towns.
