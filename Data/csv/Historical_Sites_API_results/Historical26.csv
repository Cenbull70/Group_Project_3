Monticello Community Historical Society,"23860 W 83rd St, Shawnee",Shawnee,4.3,10,38.97801,-94.862608,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Very small place with a focus on only one man who had a connection with Buffalo Bill Cody. It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

The HQ has a a few posters and books for sale but most of the historical material is in the larger space on Metcalf.  There you will find exhibits showing much of the retail history of Overland Park with material from the Metcalf South Shopping Center.   Brad Moore's excellent models bring life back to the White Haven Motel, and several restaurants including he Charlie Chan Restaurant where Brad worked as a teenager in High School.  The OPHS exhibit is a bargain at ""Free"" while the downstairs Johnson County exhibit has a small admission charge. Both are worthwhile and additive  - allow about two hours for the pair."
