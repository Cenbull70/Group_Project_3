Battle of Punished Woman's Fork National Historic Site,"67871, Scott City",Scott City,4.8,73,38.6435538,-100.9279405,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was maybe the highlight of our trip. We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."
Little Pyramids,"Elk, Oakley",Oakley,4.2,18,38.7566683,-100.9486703,"point_of_interest, establishment",These formations look amazing during the golden hour in the morning. The birds nesting on the formations are super active. Great little pull over on the way to the badlands

Sherman County Historical Society,"202 W 13th St, Goodland",Goodland,3.8,4,39.3460972,-101.7134327,"point_of_interest, establishment",My husband and I were traveling through the area and had the good fortune to find the Historical Society open. The gentleman there was extremely knowledgeable and provided us a great tour of the building and the artifacts displayed there. We purchased an Oral History Book that was published in 1998 of folks who had grown up in the area which we found very interesting. The visit to both Goodland and St Francis was  so nice and we were very glad we ventured off the Interstate to explore these friendly towns.

Butterfield Overland Despatch Trail Marker,Grinnell,Grinnell,5,2,38.7890678,-100.7629312,"point_of_interest, establishment","in the 1800s the Monument Rocks served as a landmark on the way to Denver, before roads, so this marker is for the Smokey Hill Trail for gold seekers in wagons on their way to Denver."
El Cuartelejo,Scott City,Scott City,4.5,4,38.6768293,-100.9148925,"point_of_interest, establishment","This is a fascinating bit of history, connected with Native and Spanish interactions in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, from well before the Revolutionary War. The state park itself also has some really nice hiking/biking/horse trails and lots of camping, next to a scenic lake with fishing, swimming, and boating."
Mingo - Oldest Active Geocache in the World,Colby,Colby,4.9,64,39.277916,-100.9436992,"point_of_interest, establishment","The new plaque was stolen, apparently. Still a neat piece of obscure history.

Monument Rocks,Oakley,Oakley,4.8,310,38.7954826,-100.7641158,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This place was pretty awesome.

We did a Midwest road trip and was determined to see one 'tourist attraction' in each state we visited.

Going through West Kansas, there wasn't much to choose from.  My husband was watching one of his 'nature shows', and Monument Rocks were mentioned.  Added to our Road Trip!

Off State Highway,  83, it's a little bit off the beaten path.  About 15 mins down a dirt/gravel road.

It's on private property,  but it's open to the public.....and it's free. Open,  basically from Dawn to Dusk. There is no bathroom,  concession, or souvenir shop. Just park your vehicle and get out and explore.

We visited just under an hour. I found it very peaceful.  And it wasn't trashed. A small sign explains how they came about."

So much they are allowed to touch and explore. They have dinosaurs and trains and butter churners and play horses to ride. It was so much great stuff to learn and so much fun stuff to explore.

A tremendous place to learn about Pueblan history that was surprising to find in this part of the country."

Not the best stop on i-70 for a quick activity, one could spend 2 hours here easily. The fick fossil museum is better for a quick stop."
