It's all outdoors with a couple of markers and some info. Our visit, June 23, was during the time trees are completely leafed out so even though the river wasn't that far away, we couldn't begin to see it from where we were. There were some trails leading back into the woods, but we decided they were a little too narrow and semi overgrown to feel comfortable about picking up critters like ticks. Good place to use your imagination!"
