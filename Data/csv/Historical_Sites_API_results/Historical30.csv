Cloud County Historical Museum,"635 Broadway St, Concordia",Concordia,4.9,32,39.5706754,-97.6588463,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This is really an impressive museum.  You can tell that the efforts of many citizen volunteers went into making this happen.  That is very much to be respected.  It provides a cross-section of the unique way life in the area past and present.
Mitchell County Historical Society Museum,"1915 N Independence Ave, Beloit",Beloit,4.8,6,39.4783376,-98.1175449,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",It has moved and has not been updated in Google Maps
Bohemian Hall,Glasco,Glasco,4.7,7,39.2630639,-97.9111585,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's not a restaurant. It's a Hall in the country with very little around. It's a great place, but there's no air conditioning."
Lincoln County Kansas Historical Museum,"216 W Lincoln Ave, Lincoln",Lincoln,5,20,39.0403999,-98.15022549999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Entry is by donation: make sure to put some change in their bin and buy some things in the gift shop area.

They have SO MUCH STUFF. I wish they had the budget to make the displays some of these items deserve.
We recently bought a historic home in the area, and they were so helpful telling us all about the previous owner (who built the home) and then the owner after that. It's from 1907 and has only had 3 owners!!! They got us some pictures, showed us some unique stuff, and made us laugh.
We will, of course, be returning.

Accessibility ♿️: 4/5 They have many things to look at on the first level, but the upstairs has all the military displays, and I don't think you would be able to access that or rooms in the back. Also, the bathroom would be suitable for a wheelchair, but not ideal.

Kid Friendly: 2/5 They were very kind, and I think kids would enjoy this, but there are a lot of precious invaluable items at toddler height. I would suggest bringing a stroller to strap them into or holding them the whole time. Would be a great learning opportunity for school-aged kids"

Donations for entrance appreciated.

Could use some dusting, signage, and organizing
