Historic Lecompton,"640 E Woodson Ave, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.7,132,39.0445903,-95.3921085,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",This museum is definitely worth your time for a nostalgic trip to the past. From the beautiful and historic Christmas tree displays to all of the artifacts from the wars and time gone past. This museum is a real gem.
Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, park, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."

The period-costumed docent gave an inspiring 15 minute chat about the events that happened in Lecompton and its effect on the 1860 election and the history of the United States. The first floor has some well-designed displays.

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!

Lyon County History Center,"711 Commercial St, Emporia",Emporia,4.5,49,38.4066724,-96.1803561,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We visited for the playroom and exhibits.
We were very impressed with the play area: it seems like an enriching place for all ages.  There's a variety of activities, including magnet poetry, Legos, a play garden, shop, and house, and much more.
The exhibits are fun, but I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, I enjoy local history, and there's plenty here."
Red Rocks State Historic Site,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4,25,38.4096136,-96.1753485,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","William Allen White's historic home called Red Rocks is an interesting place steeped in history. It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."

Jensen Ackles took a picture there a few years before the end of the show üôå
It looks smaller on picture than it is in real life though, if you're trying to climb on it, it is really narrow but totally worth it! üíØ"
Watkins Community Museum-History,"1047 Massachusetts St, Lawrence",Lawrence,4.7,201,38.96397,-95.23611079999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","A beautiful, historical bldg. Quite a detailed set of permanent exhibits. And they have 4 rotating exhibits so always come back to see what's  new. I had just an hour to spend here, it was enough to thoroughly examine one exhibit and most of another. The rest I just quickly looked at. Plan an afternoon to enjoy it leisurely. Then enjoy the local food places there are several very close by."
Wabaunsee County Historical Society & Museum,"227 Missouri Ave, Alma",Alma,4.7,13,39.0126409,-96.2896837,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great little museum of local history, covering Wabaunsee County from its frontier days. Lots and lots of exhibits spread out through the building.

When I visited in July 2022, the museum was undergoing some minor renovations in part of the building. Not sure if that might have affected the layout (the part with various historic washing machines seem to be rather crowded together, preventing a really good look). But it is still a fascinating look at Kansas history. I definitely plan on returning in a few months after the renovations are done."
