Historic Fort Leavenworth,Atchison,Atchison,3.6,9,39.4322232,-95.08649299999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",The sign is 13 miles from said fort. Where is the historic fort itself? Probably 13 miles behind you. Or maybe it‚Äôs gone and replaced by the new fort. Don‚Äôt expect answers from this ‚Äúsite.‚Äù
Atchison County Historical Society,"Santa Fe Depot, 200 S 10th St, Atchison",Atchison,4.6,73,39.5599814,-95.1272359,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",Excellent history stop in the old depot. Atchison holds a lot of history & it's packed into this place. Great picture ops sitting in the old train engine.  Free will donation so anyone can visit! Several other fun quick stops in this town...highly recommend spending a cpl hours if passing through.
Independence Creek: Lewis and Clark historical site,"19918 314th Rd, Atchison",Atchison,4.4,16,39.6205428,-95.09854399999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",This is a fun side trip if you‚Äôre in the area. No restrooms or anything but neat to see and view Lewis & Clark‚Äôs 4th of July campsite.
Historic Lecompton,"640 E Woodson Ave, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.7,132,39.0445903,-95.3921085,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",This museum is definitely worth your time for a nostalgic trip to the past. From the beautiful and historic Christmas tree displays to all of the artifacts from the wars and time gone past. This museum is a real gem.
Tonganoxie Historical Society and Museum,"201 W Washington St, Tonganoxie",Tonganoxie,4.9,34,39.1054415,-95.09654119999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Was so surprised to see a picture of my grandmother! She grew up here on the Korb farm but didn‚Äôt know they had information about them at the museum!
Leavenworth County Historical,"1128 5th Ave, Leavenworth",Leavenworth,4.6,52,39.3066282,-94.9178134,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was an incredible house kept in pristine condition! Amazing attention to detail including pocket doors, transom windows, stained glass, hand-carved woodwork, and very knowledgeable tour guides!"
McLouth Granite Boulder,"246-298 S Granite St, McLouth",McLouth,4.6,14,39.1961296,-95.20603779999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",It was a lot more impressive 20 years ago before all the layers of pavement layers built up.
Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Monticello Community Historical Society,"23860 W 83rd St, Shawnee",Shawnee,4.3,10,38.97801,-94.862608,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Very small place with a focus on only one man who had a connection with Buffalo Bill Cody. It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, park, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."
1889 McInteer Villa,"1301 Kansas Ave, Atchison",Atchison,4.8,192,39.5632838,-95.1334962,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","My Team, Dark Tree Media, did an investigation here and it was great! The place is very well kept, clean and has a great set up. The owner was nice, although the 3pm check in was a little early for our liking. We got some good activity throughout the house and will definitely need to come back again."
Constitution Hall State Historic Site,"319 Elmore St, Lecompton",Lecompton,4.6,107,39.0454091,-95.39473219999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",One of the best tours I've ever had. The period-costumed docent gave an inspiring 15 minute chat about the events that happened in Lecompton and its effect on the 1860 election and the history of the United States. The first floor has some well-designed displays.

Old Jefferson Town,"703 Walnut St, Oskaloosa",Oskaloosa,4.5,10,39.21361419999999,-95.3095744,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Worth-the-drive destination.    Adults will love the beautifully-simple landscaping with the native grasses, split-rail fences and the views of prairie, lake and sky.   Kids could play forever in the old town setting.  Jefferson County saved a bunch of houses and businesses from the 1800s and early 1900s and moved them together to make a little town from the past.  Filmmakers should use this as a set.  The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.  Even if it's closed, you can still look inside the buildings to see what an old doctor's office or what the old grocery or hardware store had in it.  Plus there is a wonderful sculpture of a prairie wind wagon being swept up into a tornado.  I love it there."
Shawnee County Historical Society,"1118 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.7,3,39.0426068,-95.67216909999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Bob did a great job in teaching us. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable.

The caretakers have put so much amazing museum worthy antiques into each building its worth coming to see.
Please find time to go see it if you are in the area!"
