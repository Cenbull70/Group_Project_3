The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned, offering a delightful burst of flavor with each bite. The truffle mac and cheese was a true highlight, rich and creamy with the perfect hint of truffle. To top it off, the pork chops were tender and juicy. The ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the service was exceptional.

Additionally, the restaurant boasts a great bar with decent specials, making it an ideal spot for both dining and socializing. This is definitely a place I'll be returning to soon!"

The staff is wonderful, helpful and knows so much they can share. Anyone who loves history, antiques, and the like will love it. They have displays of everything from military history, letters, photos, art - you name it. Along with a great display honoring Coach Rockne, they have local yearbooks, and even a barb wire  display. I was able to find my grandfather's high school yearbook, photos, as well as pictures of my great grandfather and grandmother Mahlon and Rhoda hanging upstairs. I never knew he had a greenhouse in the town in the early 1900s

What a wonderful visit! I highly encourage anyone to check this place out, whether they have a local connection to it or not. It is a great town and 100% worth the diversion to spend some time here."

Theyvwere well marked out along the route, but you have to use your imagination and knowledge of that era to get a good mental picture of what the trail is all about. The trail is only for serious history buffs."

I've seen this old mill on three separate occasions in the last few years.  Unfortunately, it looks like it will need extensive work and restoration, especially at the foundations close to the Cottonwood River.  But it has so much potential - and it would be sad for this historic old structure to go to waste and simply wither away like so many old buildings in rural Kansas."

Most are nicer and most don’t have 9 ft tall shadow men with hats. Not sure what all that was about but they didn’t seem to bother me much once I explained I was there to bury some evidence.
No line and no wait time. Nice that I can just walk up and see it up close.
Came here with my 4 sons and cat and they all went missing but the cat. Cant complain too much.
3/10 could’ve been cleaner."
