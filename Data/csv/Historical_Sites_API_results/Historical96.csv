Battle of Punished Woman's Fork National Historic Site,"67871, Scott City",Scott City,4.8,73,38.6435538,-100.9279405,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was maybe the highlight of our trip. We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."

Historic Lake Scott State Park,"101 W Scott Lake Dr, Scott City",Scott City,4.5,382,38.6853256,-100.9252166,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","We are staying in the Circle Drive Campground with electricity and water. Dump site available down the road.

Two shower/bathrooms are available. One with a separate women’s and men’s. I personally like the unisex facility as you have your own space with a lockable door.

This is a pretty little lake with a small area designated for swimming and two spots with playground equipment.

We have taken advantage of visiting Little Jerusalem Badlands and Monument Rocks.  So worth it.

We would definitely come back to this site."

Interesting fossils, history, nice people. Lovely gift shop. We loved the painted 1948 Suburban, and we were grateful for their clean little outhouse after we'd driven 90 minutes and spent another hour at Monument Rocks. Recommend stopping here, especially if you like rocks!"
