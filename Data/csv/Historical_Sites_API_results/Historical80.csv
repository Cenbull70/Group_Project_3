Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum,"204 S Main St, Wichita",Wichita,4.7,241,37.6847302,-97.33786979999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, art_gallery, park, store, point_of_interest, establishment","Well- worth one's time!  This gem of a local museum dedicated to the history of the Wichita and its environs in Sedgwick County is well worth the effort to explore.  The volunteer staff is friendly, intelligent, and helpful, the museum store is ideal with many small gifts to select from, and the parking is easy on a weekend (I went on a Sunday afternoon when the downtown area was largely uninhabited.) As another reviewer commented, the museum is definitely geared toward adults, and I concur. However, children might be engaged for an hour or so exploring the classically restored building and viewing items from previous generations. The building has been magnificently restored to its original stately bearing, which in and of itself makes a visit worth one's time and effort. Don't forget to leave a donation if you can as this non-profit museum is well worth preserving for future generations."

My family visited for the annual tea party and it was exquisite!! I would have paid 2x the price for the tickets for an extra 30 minutes.   ðŸ¤£ so my only complaint about that event was that I couldn't sit there all day and enjoy the wonderful ambiance they created. It is truly a special event. We look forward to going  back to thoroughly explore the museum."

Soldiers and Sailors Monument,"101 E 1st Ave, Hutchinson",Hutchinson,4,3,38.0532316,-97.92988100000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","The Soldiers and Sailors Monument in downtown Hutchinson is truly a sight to behold. Standing tall, it serves as a poignant memorial to honor our veterans. The monument is flanked by two large cannons, adding to its majestic presence. At the base, beautiful flowers are meticulously maintained, providing a serene and respectful atmosphere. It's a fitting tribute to those who have served, and a must-see for anyone visiting Hutchinson."
Towanda Kansas Historical Marker,"Q288+3G, Towanda",Towanda,4.2,10,37.765154,-96.98370779999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","No TP menâ€™s room in none of the 9 stalls. Also, toilet  seats loose slide all over the place. Also, they have not clean the inside of the stall or door walls and what looks like a year worth of unfortunately spittle. They need to take a garden hose and wash all walls down. And use soap not just water to wash all the stall walls."

Delano Clock Tower,Wichita,Wichita,4.5,22,37.6840349,-97.346959,"point_of_interest, establishment","Ok, I'm not sure why I am being hit up to rate the clock tower at the Douglas roundabout, but ok, here goes... It's a clock, it's always had the right time on it on my way by, it's nice looking and definitely compliments the area in my humble opinion. I hope Google's happy, they goaded me into reviewing a clock."

Historical Museum & Library,"203 N Main St, Newton",Newton,2,2,38.0441586,-97.3453629,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Twice we have tried to visit this place. On both the website and the door of the building itself, it says that is open 1st and 3rd Saturdays from 10-4. We have tried both Saturdays. This has happened so many times with both this building and others in Newton that I now believe Newton should just be renamed ""Disappointment"". If the building is actually closed for good, please update the website or provide a sign on the door."
