Asylum Bridge,Osawatomie,Osawatomie,4.6,35,38.50516349999999,-94.941989,"point_of_interest, establishment","Absolutely beautiful, stunning, kind of falling apart, but mother nature is not a force to be reckoned with. heh I love visiting famous and historic old bridges and I was quite shocked to not see any ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù sign on the entrance to the bridge, it is gated, but maybe that‚Äôs just for safety concern?. I wasn‚Äôt about to walk across those rotten planks to the gushing tide beneath. üòÖ

I‚Äôm from Ottawa and we have a similar bridge in our town built in 1903 - Warren Truss Bridge however our bridge has been restored and it‚Äôs been converted into part of the Flint Hills Nature Trail!

This bridge looks like it could use a little restoration maybe, But then again, if you cross the bridge, you end up at the back of the Osawatomie Asylum so I can understand why they probably don‚Äôt want a bunch of traffic going through there.

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a new piece of Kansas history and it‚Äôs well worth a visit!

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!

We'll there is a gravel parking area and stairs down to the water but the water was high when we were there and it would have been dangerous to swim. There is a small dam just before the bridge but be careful of the reverse current.

What made our visit so great was our visit with Mike, the museum guide. He was so anxious to talk to us about the exhibits and point out things we wouldn't want to miss. It is two-stories, that include a large model train town on the first floor, and an old one-room classroom, Victorian living room, kitchen, ice cream parlor, and a general store on the second floor. We stayed over an hour to see all the items that Mike pointed out. We loved the story about the Naked Voters! The museum is free but everyone will want to contribute to the donation box."

The museum's exterior is meant to look like the armory at Harpers Ferry. The sight of John Brown's infamous last stand. Inside is his cabin. The Adair Cabin was moved from the original spot down the road. It was very cool being inside the cabin, inside the museum. They have some wonderful relics that belonged to the legend himself. The staff were extremely kind and friendly. But best of all was that the allowed my pup inside. That said, my pup, Pennylane is extremely well behaved and exceedingly beautiful. She also loves John Brown and has even been to many of the other relevant sites around the country. Don't miss this gem of a historic site!"
