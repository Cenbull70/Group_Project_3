Kansas Historical Marker and Scenic View of Kansas Bluestem Prairie,"1866, Old Hwy 50, Strong City",Strong City,4.7,33,38.4008116,-96.5030268,"point_of_interest, establishment","Very informative, and a good chance to stretch your legs for a minute. I do believe that there could be more here, though: a trashcan, water spigot, a porta-john, etc. More people would definitely stop there if this were so."
Kaw Mission State Historic Site,"500 North Msn, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,61,38.665916,-96.49394099999999,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped while traveling to stretch our legs on the walking path along the water. This historic site was in front of the parking area for walking. It was an interesting site that we weren't expecting. I don't think it was open that day, and I'm not certain it's a place you can enter. The buildings were nice to see, as well as the information posted near them, on the signs I shared here in my photos."
Old School House,"10967 Wilmington Rd, Harveyville",Harveyville,5,1,38.7448722,-95.96439149999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Down the road less traveled now but it has a lot of history about the Santa Fe Trail.
Allegawaho Memorial Heritage Park,"S 525 Rd, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.3,20,38.6257382,-96.4315409,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","I came here on a whim and it really surprised me. The park itself was gorgeous with beautiful tallgrass prairies, old growth forests, and tons of wildflowers. The couple ruins on the site are also interesting. Another thing about this park is that it's currently being revitalised with new walking paths, a visitor centre, and hopefully more informational signs. The park also very recently got a hold of a massive quartzite boulder that has been revered by the Kaw for centuries and is now on display. Overall, a very nice park in the Flint Hills with a lot of promising things happening!"
William Allen White Historic,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4.9,39,38.4096192,-96.1753485,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Wonderful tour! Loved all the artifacts that they had on display. Really made the tour kid friendly for our 4th graders!
Teter Rock,"2555 300th, Eureka",Eureka,4.8,173,38.02956270000001,-96.42356370000002,"point_of_interest, establishment","Really enjoyed visiting Teeter Rock. The road to it is a long dusty country gravel road but is an enjoyable ride. The pathway up to the top of the hill where the rock is placed is long ( close to a mile) but my small 4x2 truck made it up effortlessly. I chose to drive very slowly since it’s not maintained in any way.

When we were there on Memorial Day weekend the wild mustangs were visible nearby."
Former Missouri-Kansas-Texas Depot,"512 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,5,1,38.6618761,-96.4801873,"point_of_interest, establishment","This the new home for the Council Grove Visitor Center and the have lots of info for the area.
Plus it’s inside one of the last MKT railroad depots in Kansas! It is a great depot and I’m glad the city has taken it over and a rehab is hopefully coming!"
Pioneer Jail,"507 E Main St, Council Grove",Council Grove,4.5,13,38.6618794,-96.4807063,"point_of_interest, establishment","Not much to it but it looks authentic. You can go inside the front ""lobby"" and see inside the two jail cells. Pretty sparse!"
Lyon County History Center,"711 Commercial St, Emporia",Emporia,4.5,49,38.4066724,-96.1803561,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We visited for the playroom and exhibits.
We were very impressed with the play area: it seems like an enriching place for all ages.  There's a variety of activities, including magnet poetry, Legos, a play garden, shop, and house, and much more.
The exhibits are fun, but I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, I enjoy local history, and there's plenty here."
Native Stone Scenic Byway Historical Marker,Alma,Alma,4.8,19,38.9073333,-96.27991329999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Beautiful Kansas. Mind-boggling stone fencing. Rolling hills and winding roads.
Red Rocks State Historic Site,"927 Exchange St, Emporia",Emporia,4,25,38.4096136,-96.1753485,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","William Allen White's historic home called Red Rocks is an interesting place steeped in history. It has been restored and they have done a marvelous job in making it appear to be lived in.

I was surprised by the size of the interior; it is much larger than I had anticipated. Some of it is ornate and some of it is rather common.

It has many interesting photographs of famous people, I was surprised to see a photograph of William Allen White and Albert Einstein and it looks like it was taken in the same room where the photograph is displayed among many others.

The artifacts and furniture are well-preserved; it is easy to imagine the White family living there.

In one of the photographs you will see the admission price and hours of operation; I hope that is helpful.

In addition to the home, a visitor center is in the spacious backyard. Moreover an old black Cadillacs is a garage-like structure in the driveway.

Around Christmas time they may have an open house with holiday music and carolers. It is only for one afternoon and only one day. Although that is when I visited, I would have paid the full admission price. Expect to pay full price at other times.

I live in the same neighborhood several blocks away and it is relatively safe. Parking should not be an issue. In addition, William Allen White Elementary School is across the street with a playground if you are bringing younger children along."
Osage County Historical Society,"631 Topeka Ave, Lyndon",Lyndon,4.6,12,38.6096926,-95.6842973,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Courteous, helpful, and knowledgeable about the contents there. One time visit is probably not enough time to find all they have that one may want for their research."
DAR Santa Fe Trail Crossing Monument,Council Grove,Council Grove,4.3,4,38.6528785,-96.57687349999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",There's enough of a pull off for a 26' RV to get in and turn around!  Historic monument that brings attention to what would otherwise be an overlooked spot on the Historic Santa Fe Trail.

Chase County Historical Society & Museum,"301 Broadway St, Cottonwood Falls",Cottonwood Falls,4.7,24,38.3718966,-96.5418717,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great place! The staff is wonderful, helpful and knows so much they can share. Anyone who loves history, antiques, and the like will love it. They have displays of everything from military history, letters, photos, art - you name it. Along with a great display honoring Coach Rockne, they have local yearbooks, and even a barb wire  display. I was able to find my grandfather's high school yearbook, photos, as well as pictures of my great grandfather and grandmother Mahlon and Rhoda hanging upstairs. I never knew he had a greenhouse in the town in the early 1900s

What a wonderful visit! I highly encourage anyone to check this place out, whether they have a local connection to it or not. It is a great town and 100% worth the diversion to spend some time here."
