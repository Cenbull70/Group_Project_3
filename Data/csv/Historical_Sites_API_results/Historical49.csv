I know that may not make sense, but when you’re living in a large city, small things like this put a smile on my face.

The barn is unattended but is well maintained and operates on the honor system.

Unlatch the barn door and turn the lights on. You can read about its history on the walls located on the first level inside the barn."

Santa Fe Trail Tracks,"US-400, Fort Dodge",Fort Dodge,4,255,37.7895652,-100.1977533,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Basically impossible to see the tracks as of early October. However, the surrounding views are gorgeous, with prairie grass waving and very colorful. I wonder if they should put up something to block weather, as it seems like all the Santa Fe track sites I visited are deteriorating. It feels like something could be done to preserve them better. Either way, the site is still in a beautiful spot, just beware of the heavy construction traffic on these roads to the site, I do not recommend taking this highway any further than to this site."
