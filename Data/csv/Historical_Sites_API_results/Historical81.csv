The site is unmolested and presented as it was while the original family lived there.  The property maintains most of it's original furniture and fixtures.  The caretaker/staff member was incredibly knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  100% worth stopping if you enjoy Kansas history and want to see a home that has mostly untouched over time.

Biked through en route from Fort Collins CO to Oakley KS. A minivan pulled up as we were leaving to continue east... this cache must see dozens of daily visitors!"

Have a number of exhibits on display. There are fossils including a large fossilized fish. There are a number of displays for things like telegraphs military clothing and things of that nature. There's a large fire truck in one room which is really cool and very pretty. I had an overall great experience here that was free and it was a long hour route.

Shiloh Vineyard & Winery,"16079 M Road, WaKeeney",WaKeeney,4.9,130,38.9571307,-100.0415972,"tourist_attraction, food, point_of_interest, establishment","We were on our way from Denver to Wichita when we spotted a billboard for this winery. We needed to stretch our legs from the long drive and the winery shares my daughter's name so we thought it would be a fun quick pit stop. What a great decision. The winery is very small but is beautiful! The owner and the couple working at the counter we so welcoming, informative, and engaging. The wines were unique and worth trying. We were on a tight time schedule and while we had only planned to stay for about 15-20 minutes we ended up staying at least an hour. Our only regret was that we did not know about this place sooner as we would have contacted them to stay overnight in their adorable  ""shed."" While the winery is 8 miles off the highway on dirt roads in the middle of nowhere (from a city dweller perspective) it was WELL worth the drop in to be able to breathe and rest."
Historic Philip Houston House B&B,"350 Kansas Ave, Rexford",Rexford,4.6,8,39.4698981,-100.7427046,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This historic home is so beautiful and ornate. The owner knows the entire history of the house and how the original family lived in it. Each room is named after one of the original family members and is furnished with period pieces. This is the perfect place for rest and rejuvenation for travelers and locals alike.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."
Kirch Haus,"438 North Main Street, WaKeeney",WaKeeney,4.7,3,39.0299254,-99.8837575,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a wonderful place to stay with family for a short vacation or getaway. It is a renovated church into a VRBO. It has four bedrooms and an extra bunk bed in the basement with four bathrooms and lots of common space upstairs and down. The property itself isn't very large, so there isn't much room for outdoor activities, but our family appreciated the acoustics of the church nave area for our family devotions and hymns while we were there. They even incorporated church furniture into the renovation, like using the altar for the kitchen island, and the baptismal font into a bathroom vanity. It is sad to see churches close, but nice to see that this one can still be used and preserved in this unique way."
West Bound Rest Area,"Unnamed Road, Grainfield",Grainfield,4.3,238,39.0999676,-100.4260929,"point_of_interest, establishment",Not that whole area is clean very easy in and out. Well kept it says that it has security system in use on property has some historical information vending machines and restroom a little picnic area and barbecue if you happen to have Kohls with you.
