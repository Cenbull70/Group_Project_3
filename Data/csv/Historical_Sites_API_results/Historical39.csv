Historic Adobe Museum,"300 E Oklahoma Ave, Ulysses",Ulysses,4.8,31,37.5770652,-101.3552232,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment",A sudden change in weather forced us to cancel our distance travel plans so decided to make a short trip to visit this museum since we already had day together planned. Was well worth the 30 minute drive. An excellent museum that showcases the changes in the area over the past 150 years. The exhibits are well put together and organized for a visitor to have an educational tour as you wonder through the museum.  Much more to see than what you might expect for a small town. Admittance is free but consider leaving a donation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming.

I didn't do the tour, I just viewed the museum and bought souvenirs from the gift shop. The cashier was very kind and we enjoyed a chat while I shopped. Definitely worth stopping in! I included pics from the entrance."

Has lots of local history. It's not like a big city museum but I really enjoyed it!!! I love the local history and pics...etc. Kind of takes you back to another time! The girl there, attendant, was very nice! There was not a fee to get in but there is a donation box (we left donations as we had planned to pay to get in anyway)."
Caroline Henderson Homestead,Texhoma,Texhoma,3.8,5,36.80511080000001,-101.871791,"point_of_interest, establishment",Not much left to the old place. There are cows roaming the property and the property owner had put up a fence to keep  his cows in. The house looks timeless in its advanced state of decay sitting lonely out on the plains.

Wagon Bed Spring,Sullivan,Sullivan,4.5,2,37.39835619999999,-101.3707193,"natural_feature, establishment","I have tried to get to the spring twice. The roads where flooded the first time and today I could get to the turn off road to the spring and it is fenced off. I went around to two other routes to the spring and they were fenced off as well. Not sure how to get to it. I reached out to the Ulysses tourist board for further information on how to access this national monument.

Update: I received a call back from tourist board and they looked into the matter and made me aware of some road wash outs that were being repaired and an event coming up 8/19/2023. I look forward to visiting then to see the site."
