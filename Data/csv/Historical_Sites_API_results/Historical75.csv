Pawnee Rock State Historic Site,"631 N Centre St, Pawnee Rock",Pawnee Rock,4.7,176,38.2723361,-98.98216310000001,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Never knew this existed.  Interesting piece of history along the Santa Fe trail.  You can walk to the top of a platform that is as high as the ""rock"" once was.  The view is pretty amazing.  Many names and initials (some very new) are carved into the rocks.  Cool historic spot."
B-29 Memorial Plaza,Great Bend,Great Bend,4.7,16,38.3472756,-98.84984709999999,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was a very informative and interesting memorial. I enjoyed it, but it was very sobering. Lots of history with a neat dedication to the men and women who have served in the armed forces."

Fort Larned National Historic Site,"1767 KS-156, Larned",Larned,4.8,499,38.182531,-99.2211372,"tourist_attraction, museum, park, point_of_interest, establishment","This place is wonderful. Wish we had more time while here. Staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. Buildings are beautifully preserved/replicated.  There was a blacksmith on site when we visited, and he was very engaging with our family."
Pratt County Historical Museum,"208 S Ninnescah St, Pratt",Pratt,4.8,66,37.6445462,-98.73800519999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This unassuming diamond in the rough is a must see place to visit when in Pratt, Kansas.

The museum holds an amazing collection of artifacts (photographs, historical documents, collectables and even machinery) from a bygone era!

The displays relate to Pratt County, the town of Pratt and also the state of Kansas.

There are amazing displays of fossils and Indian items (arrowheads and dresses) along with collections of clothes, hats and shoes from the late 19th century into the 20th!

The museum, at first glance appears  deceptively small but in actuality, I believe it takes up most, if not all, of the square block it sits on!

So much so, that when I mentioned ""machinery"" I did not only mean stuff like toasters, typewriters and hand tools but also full on combine engines and John Deere tractors!

In addition, they have many storefronts like a bank, telephone, dentist office, etc., where you can go inside and view how it was set up in the past.

There is just too much at the museum to write it all here. Besides, I am sure that if I returned, I would see/notice stuff that I missed the first go around (and I was there for over 90 minutes).

Finally, a shout out to the very nice ladies that were ""running"" the museum! They were very nice to talk with and gave information as to what more to do while in Pratt!

Highly recommend!"
Buffalo Bill's Well on the Santa Fe Trail,"12th Rd, Lyons",Lyons,4,14,38.3338561,-98.27565560000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Unfortunately, the well is no more than a plate welded flush with the ground. It's a nice side trip off the main highway but there's nothing to see but a small sign with limited details. Wish there was more about the Santa Fe Trail crossing which was apparently important enough for someone to dig a well but those details aren't explained. It is a clean area for a quick leg stretch but not much else."
Boyd's Ranch Historical Marker,"S, Pawnee St, Larned",Larned,3.7,3,38.1732144,-99.16003549999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",When I stopped to read marker had 4 whitetail does standing around it and they were not spooked.

The building needs demolished it has been for sale for years and is just being vandalized. Nothing of interest at this camp anymore, even the little red house has been moved."

Santa Fe Trail Park,"840 Avenue N, Chase",Chase,4,1,38.3330244,-98.34057639999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","This small park has a few visible ruts from the Santa Fe Trail and an old Buffalo Wallow. There is a gravel parking area right off the road- probably big enough for 3-4 cars. A large sign put up by the Fort Larned Historical Society details the history of the site. The ruts themselves are visible, but probably would be easy to miss if you don't know what you are looking for. If you are interested in trail history, this site is great to see one of the few remaining physical ruts!"
Coronado Quivira Museum,"105 W Lyon St, Lyons",Lyons,4.6,39,38.3456946,-98.2036586,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",There's an awesome variety of stuff in this museum! It starts out with Native American stuff and professes through time and includes Coronado and genuine chain mail from Spanish conquistadors! There is also a basement with more recent relics including a one of a kind car that is aimed to be the last of its kind!! It is free for locals and children and only costs $3 for guest adults! Very fair pricing and great to check out!!
