Eastern Colorado Historical Society Museum,Cheyenne Wells,Cheyenne Wells,4.3,3,38.8206445,-102.3511753,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Really cool gem in the small town of Cheyenne Wells. If your passing through, it is a neat find."
Amache National Historic Site,"County Rd 23 5/10, Granada",Granada,4.5,115,38.056303,-102.329192,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Amache is the newest national historic site (as of June 2024). Additionally, it was one of 10 sites used as Japanese internment camps during World War 2. It is a little bare as it was run mostly by volunteers prior to becoming a nps site. However, you can drive through, but it is mostly just building foundations. You can tell that they are continuing to rebuild. Be aware that it is a dirt road through the site and there are no rangers working or bathrooms available at this time."
Museum of the Great Plains,"401 S 4th St, Leoti",Leoti,4.9,14,38.4827597,-101.3581745,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Such a great museum, so many rooms and displays are set up very well. A lot of work went into each area. There's a basement too!"
Fort Wallace Museum,"2655 U.S. Hwy 40, Wallace",Wallace,4.7,262,38.9103451,-101.5828513,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This was a great stop for my 1 yo and 3 yo. So much they are allowed to touch and explore. They have dinosaurs and trains and butter churners and play horses to ride. It was so much great stuff to learn and so much fun stuff to explore.

Signature Block,"2MWG+XW, Granada",Granada,4,2,38.0474521,-102.3226355,"point_of_interest, establishment","Very interesting place to visit. Not sure I'd say so interesting that I'd make a trip here from a place like Denver only for this...but if you happen to be in the area I would absolutely stop by. Good signage to learn about the camp. They have restored many of the buildings. Good to learn about our past, so we (hopefully) don't make the same mistakes in the future."
Amache Museum,"205 E Goff Ave, Granada",Granada,4.7,77,38.0625626,-102.3087662,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a free museum to visit and experience. Parking is also free in the neighboring bank lot or on the side street. As of May 2024 you can also find the national park passport stamp here just inside the main entry door on the left. There are free restrooms here, too. The exhibits are really extensive, plus they feature many donated items from actual internment camp inmates. It's a great look at a terrible decision in our country's history. The only major downside is no staff was inside the museum to ask questions to or welcome us in."

Fort Wallace Post Cemetery,Wallace,Wallace,4.7,10,38.9029021,-101.5595393,"cemetery, point_of_interest, establishment",this  is  where  the  actual  fort  was  located  though  nothing  remains  except  the  cemetery.   A  good  GPS  app  or  a  state atlas  is  recommended  to  find  this  place.  A  more  challenging  place  to  find  but  worth  the  effort.

CDOT Rest Area: Holly,"Milepost 467.39, US-50, Holly",Holly,4.3,116,38.0494672,-102.0514306,"point_of_interest, establishment","came through an amazing, powerful storm leaving Kansas and took these pictures from the truck while entering Colorado and then pulled into this little rest area. we didn't use the facilities but the place appeared to be clean but old and outdated unless that is the theme and we didn't use it enough to know. we stopped to take pictures of this amazing sunset after a terrible storm but this place was not good for that. it's on the low side of the highway and the view was obstructed everywhere. I walked up to the highway hoping for better but I got better pictures while in the moving vehicle"
