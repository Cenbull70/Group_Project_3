Although the sign in front and Google maps say that Ã­ts hours of operation start from 10:30am on Saturdays, it was closed the first time I came (11am ""ish"") with a sign saying something in the lines of ""we'll come back soon"" so I visited again at noon, same sign there, same situation so I continued my way to Oklahoma.
