We were unsure how much time we could spend looking around and only planned for about 30 minutes. We could have easily spent hours there digesting all the amazing history of the area. The staff were so welcoming as well. Definitely worth the visit!

We were particularly interested in the Teterville oilfield area where my parents and sister lived.  The three volunteers who stayed late to help us were amazing representatives of both their craft and community.  Never have I experienced a more knowledgeable, helpful crew.  Thank you for all you did."

This historical landmark is worth a stop if you're on the way, and then worth visiting Walter Johnson's birthplace a few miles north if you're interested."

Covered Rail Bridge New Albany KS,Fredonia,Fredonia,5,4,37.5822417,-95.9561293,"point_of_interest, establishment","This spot is gorgeous. I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."

Road down to Fall River is very rough so parking at top of mill near water plant and walking down is probably a better choice if you don't have 4WD and more importantly high clearance.
