The site is unmolested and presented as it was while the original family lived there.  The property maintains most of it's original furniture and fixtures.

We were at a KOA campground in WaKeeney, just 20 miles away from the Boyhood Home of Walter Chrysler.We decided to stay another night and visit this place: it is a wonderful place to see. I am glad we did. Too much history is lost, the preservation of historic spots like this is so important."

Shiloh Vineyard & Winery,"16079 M Road, WaKeeney",WaKeeney,4.9,130,38.9571307,-100.0415972,"tourist_attraction, food, point_of_interest, establishment","We were on our way from Denver to Wichita when we spotted a billboard for this winery. We needed to stretch our legs from the long drive and the winery shares my daughter's name so we thought it would be a fun quick pit stop. What a great decision. The winery is very small but is beautiful! The owner and the couple working at the counter we so welcoming, informative, and engaging. The wines were unique and worth trying. We were on a tight time schedule and while we had only planned to stay for about 15-20 minutes we ended up staying at least an hour. Our only regret was that we did not know about this place sooner as we would have contacted them to stay overnight in their adorable  ""shed."" While the winery is 8 miles off the highway on dirt roads in the middle of nowhere (from a city dweller perspective) it was WELL worth the drop in to be able to breathe and rest."
Kirch Haus,"438 North Main Street, WaKeeney",WaKeeney,4.7,3,39.0299254,-99.8837575,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a wonderful place to stay with family for a short vacation or getaway. It is a renovated church into a VRBO. It has four bedrooms and an extra bunk bed in the basement with four bathrooms and lots of common space upstairs and down. The property itself isn't very large, so there isn't much room for outdoor activities, but our family appreciated the acoustics of the church nave area for our family devotions and hymns while we were there. They even incorporated church furniture into the renovation, like using the altar for the kitchen island, and the baptismal font into a bathroom vanity. It is sad to see churches close, but nice to see that this one can still be used and preserved in this unique way."
Webster State Park,"1140 10 Rd, Stockton",Stockton,4.6,262,39.421989,-99.4342088,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Webster is a very expansive park with numerous campgrounds within.  We stayed in Hill Top where about half of the sites were pull through, all in the sun, gravel, water, electricity.  We were there during a hazardous bacteria warning for the water so we could not take advantage of the beaches or fishing, but I'd guess it is usually lovely and a great place for families.  Some of the roads to get into the campgrounds have big chunks missing or pot holes which can be hard on tow vehicles and RVs.  Other campgrounds (old marina and eagle view) within the Park had sites with much more shade and they were lovely.  Bath houses were clean (the ones we used).  No dumpster or bathroom/house in Hill Top.  We saw some wildlife-hog nosed snake racoon, lots of birds.  Stockton is just 10 minutes away and they have dinner good things for kids-parks, playgrounds, public pool.  Our purpose for being in the area was visiting Nicodemus national historical site."

Why it's comfortable and their coffee is pretty good. Today I got a smoothie (mixed berry) an I loved it. My mom had gotten the Banana smoothie she loved it too. I would recommend this place to anyone who want to talk to friends and have a sweet or a wake up drink. Plus the employee's working there are friendly and helpful.
West Bound Rest Area,"Unnamed Road, Grainfield",Grainfield,4.3,238,39.0999676,-100.4260929,"point_of_interest, establishment",Not that whole area is clean very easy in and out.
