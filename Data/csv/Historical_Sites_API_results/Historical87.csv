Onaga Historical Society,"310 E 2nd St, Onaga",Onaga,4.9,7,39.4889827,-96.1659909,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Wonderful displays of local history, including a full-sized caboose, a one-room schoolhouse, and a settler's cabin. Marvelous way to spend an afternoon."
Historical Hand-Dug Well,"401 Road to Oz Highway, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,15,39.3962435,-96.4080357,"point_of_interest, establishment","It's amazing to read about it and to think it was hand dug. It was just sad to see that people thought it was a trashcan of some sort.... no, not the algae because that's going to be a thing in any still water situation. The plastic jugs, the shoes and other garbage floating. It's sad....but it's in a beautiful park area."
Nemaha County Historical Museum,"113 N 6th St, Seneca",Seneca,4.9,7,39.8361201,-96.0638549,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Very interesting! From the outside you'd never know the inside is full of all kinds of items from the past, some I've never seen before. Knowledgeable people inside to answer questions or give a tour.

The California-Oregon Trail Historical Marker,Westmoreland,Westmoreland,4.4,5,39.3812527,-96.4051985,"point_of_interest, establishment","This was a nice surprise finding the rest/picnic stop along our route on our way to Pawnee SRA.  It was an easy off and on from the road, and plenty of parking for our rig.  Across the road was the rest of the rest stop but perhaps too small for us to get in and out of the space with our rig.  But it was cool to read the description of this route and how for the period notes it was a regular route to California/Oregon via the wagon trail.  Good history.  The area could use a bit of maintenance but otherwise safe and clean"
Table Rock Historical Museum,"414 Houston St, Table Rock",Table Rock,4.8,6,40.1790452,-96.09640259999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Saw this wonderful old opera house being rediscovered and promoted by the robust local historical society. It's like walking through a time machine. Amazing, very enjoyable and fascinating place.  I have a feeling I only scratched the surface."
Richardson County Historical Society,"1401 Chase St, Falls City",Falls City,5,4,40.0589327,-95.6045333,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","I'm sure the museum is great and all, but the picture Google uses is a private house across the street from the museum. The picture shown is actually 1323 Chase, not 1401. They were doing repair work and it might not serve the museum well to have this picture addressed incorrectly."

Rock Creek Valley Historical Society,"507 Burkman St, Westmoreland",Westmoreland,4.3,3,39.3911853,-96.4106113,"point_of_interest, establishment","While it is a rather small history museum, it is still pretty awesome, with great displays of local history, like a doctor's office and a one room schoolhouse. On the downside, not all of the displays were labelled, and on my visit, I was guided around by a volunteer who didn't know the story of all the displays. Personally, I would have liked to have been able to walk around on my own a bit."
