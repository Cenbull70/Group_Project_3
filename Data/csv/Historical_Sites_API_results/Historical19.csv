Interesting piece of history along the Santa Fe trail.  You can walk to the top of a platform that is as high as the ""rock"" once was.  The view is pretty amazing.  Many names and initials (some very new) are carved into the rocks.  Cool historic spot."

They have been able to preserve two of the officers' homes and the enlisted men's barracks. The foundations are shown for the commanding officer's home that was sadly sold and moved away. Even the officer's outhouse is there!

The museum part of the visitor center is well done, and the short movies are well done. They have dealt with culturally sensitive topics, too.

I highly recommend seeing this site if you are traveling through or if you live there. Great for all ages."

Once inside it has multiple large rooms that are super carefully curated. There’s a nice woman that takes care of the museum and keep it super tidy.

They’ve everything from the history of the south west, to the uses of Barbed wire, how it was made, all the variations, and a room that’s a route 66 museum. There is art made with Barbed wire, all carefully displayed and very informative. This was one of the highlights of our route 66 trip.

It’s free but they take donations which will gladly left."
