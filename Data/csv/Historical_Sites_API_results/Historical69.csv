We were unsure how much time we could spend looking around and only planned for about 30 minutes. We could have easily spent hours there digesting all the amazing history of the area. The staff were so welcoming as well. Definitely worth the visit!
Allen County Historical Society,"20 S Washington Ave, Iola",Iola,4.8,26,37.9215804,-95.40575390000001,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",It is an extremely fascinating place to learn the history of Allen County and view different artifacts from past!

We were particularly interested in the Teterville oilfield area where my parents and sister lived.  The three volunteers who stayed late to help us were amazing representatives of both their craft and community.  Never have I experienced a more knowledgeable, helpful crew.  Thank you for all you did."

The Humboldt Thunderbolt,"QH3M+HW, Humboldt",Humboldt,5,2,37.753943,-95.41522599999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","A fitting tribute to a local baseball legend, and part of a town's economic revival. This historical landmark is worth a stop if you're on the way, and then worth visiting Walter Johnson's birthplace a few miles north if you're interested."
Lovers Leap Cave Dwelling,"58GM+HQ, Independence",Independence,4.3,9,37.1764599,-95.6655243,"point_of_interest, establishment",Very beautiful place in the fall. A lot of glass and graffiti. Huge waterfall real close by
Butcher Falls,"Rd 14, Sedan",Sedan,5,5,37.1472893,-96.2682028,"point_of_interest, establishment","Nice little waterfall! Wasn‚Äôt flowing as big as other times, but just being able to say that I visited a waterfall in Kansas was cool in itself. We brought our lunch and drinks and enjoyed the noise of the waterfall, while sitting on the rocks. Glad they share this with the public!"
Cherryvale Historical Museum,"215 E 4th St, Cherryvale",Cherryvale,4.3,26,37.2671827,-95.5499421,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Great roadside history attraction if you are passing through the area.  The lady running the museum said if they weren't open you could call the number on the door and someone will usually be available to come down and give a free tour.
Covered Rail Bridge New Albany KS,Fredonia,Fredonia,5,4,37.5822417,-95.9561293,"point_of_interest, establishment","This spot is gorgeous. I've only been able to visit this bridge on a cloudy day but it's set up to be stellar for photography. I mean a river, a rail bridge and a road bridge all conjoin in the same spot. Better yet, from the east side you could capture the convergence with the sun setting in behind it. Could be a really cool shot. I'll be back with a tripod and better timing next time."
Parsons Historical Museum,"401 S 18th St, Parsons",Parsons,4.5,46,37.3373895,-95.2626607,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This is an awesome place to learn history about Parsons Kansas. staff is awesome and friendly and treat you like family if you need to know something they tell you and explain everything, I recommend everybody to go check it this place is also free to go to they do take donations"

Longton Calaboose,"106 5th St, Longton",Longton,5,2,37.3782205,-96.07974209999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","Actually kind of cool for what it is. The jail is basically intact and it looks as if bad guys could be locked up in it to this day. Not sure I would drive 1000 miles to see it, but any day trip through Southeast Kansas should include this stop."

Old Mill Dam,"Mill Dam Rd, Fredonia",Fredonia,4.6,42,37.5146161,-95.8491375,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Awesome old mill and dam. Very scenic. Road down to Fall River is very rough so parking at top of mill near water plant and walking down is probably a better choice if you don't have 4WD and more importantly high clearance.

It's neat to see where Pa dug a 20' well, built a log cabin, and so much more. Modern restrooms. Great gift shop with excellent souvenirs. Almost all of the books are there for sale."
Funston Historical Home,"14 S Washington Ave, Iola",Iola,4.7,3,37.9218055,-95.4058381,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",Loved the museum and the town.
