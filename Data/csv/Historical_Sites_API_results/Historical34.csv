Historic Ritchie House,"1116 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.3,47,39.0427408,-95.6719708,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Impromptu stop at the Ritchie House and glad we did. It is much less about the actual house and more of the John Ritchie history. Had an hour long lesson from the tour guide with a slideshow providing a deep dive into the many aspects of reform Ritchie advocated for. Also had some excellent story boards in the Heritage Education Center.
Old Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site and Botanical Garden,"124 NW Fillmore St, Topeka",Topeka,4.6,464,39.0634685,-95.6833076,"tourist_attraction, museum, park, point_of_interest, establishment","What a lovely little place to walk through a touch of history. Being able to get close to architecture from such a long time ago.

I went during a time when they didn't have the buildings open to walk through them. And there was practically no one there. Which made it easy to just explore. I know that the Mansion often holds events as well. It did seem like a place with a ton more history on the inside.

This time was purely the grounds themselves. Everything around the area was well taken care of. The flowers and plants in bloom are completely outstanding. And almost everything was labeled in case you wanted to know what was growing. The paths were easily accessible, and really just a breath of fresh air.

I recommend checking out this place at least once. Personally I would like to go back when the shops are open, to get the full experience."
Old School House,"10967 Wilmington Rd, Harveyville",Harveyville,5,1,38.7448722,-95.96439149999999,"point_of_interest, establishment",Down the road less traveled now but it has a lot of history about the Santa Fe Trail.

The period-costumed docent gave an inspiring 15 minute chat about the events that happened in Lecompton and its effect on the 1860 election and the history of the United States. The first floor has some well-designed displays.

Adults will love the beautifully-simple landscaping with the native grasses, split-rail fences and the views of prairie, lake and sky.   Kids could play forever in the old town setting.  Jefferson County saved a bunch of houses and businesses from the 1800s and early 1900s and moved them together to make a little town from the past.  Filmmakers should use this as a set.  The old, high, wooden sidewalks are like big decks connecting the buildings.  Even if it's closed, you can still look inside the buildings to see what an old doctor's office or what the old grocery or hardware store had in it.  Plus there is a wonderful sculpture of a prairie wind wagon being swept up into a tornado.  I love it there."
Shawnee County Historical Society,"1118 SE Madison St, Topeka",Topeka,4.7,3,39.0426068,-95.67216909999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Bob did a great job in teaching us. He‚Äôs very knowledgeable.

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!

There are two interesting historical markers describing the crossing and the military road, plus a pavilion over a single picnic table. Barely enough parking for a couple cars parked single file; since there's no room to turn around, you'll have to back up into the road. This place is also on the opposite side of the creek (and several dozen yards from) the Vieux family cemetery."

Jensen Ackles took a picture there a few years before the end of the show üôå
It looks smaller on picture than it is in real life though, if you're trying to climb on it, it is really narrow but totally worth it! üíØ"
