St Jacob's Well,Ashland,Ashland,4.7,18,37.2403698,-99.9818331,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","It was an interesting place.  The road that leads to the well is quite rough.  I wasn't even sure if vehicles were allowed on it.  I started walking, but turned back to grab my car due to the how hot it was and not having planned to hike.  I drove as far as I could, about 1 mile, until I came across a rut several feet long that I didn't know if I could squeeze by, so I parked in the grass and walked the rest of the way.  Aside from being rough, the road is also only wide enough for one vehicle.  There are a few flat pull off areas, but it'd still be tricky if you approached a vehicle coming the opposite direction.  I was there on a Summer day and didn't see anyone, so chances are you'll have the place almost to yourself.  I spent about 15 minutes at the well and the area on top of the hill by the windmill, before walking back to my car.  I didn't check out the Living Water Monument, so I can't speak on that or the road leading to it.  Surprisingly, I didn't find any ticks on me, but it was grasshopper galore.  I arrived back at my car to find roughly 20 or 30 of them on my front bumper.  If you came when the weather is nice, there's a lot of hiking opportunity if you're willing to just walk the roads instead of driving.  It was a nice place to see, but I'm not sure I'll go back."
Fromme-Birney Round Barn,"O St, Mullinville",Mullinville,4.8,55,37.5268447,-99.5088388,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","When driving down the dirt road,  approaching the round barn, I thought how neat it was that it was in the middle of nowhere. I know that may not make sense, but when you‚Äôre living in a large city, small things like this put a smile on my face.

The barn is unattended but is well maintained and operates on the honor system.

Unlatch the barn door and turn the lights on. You can read about its history on the walls located on the first level inside the barn."
