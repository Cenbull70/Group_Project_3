Buffalo Bill's Well on the Santa Fe Trail,"12th Rd, Lyons",Lyons,4,14,38.3338561,-98.27565560000001,"point_of_interest, establishment","Unfortunately, the well is no more than a plate welded flush with the ground. It's a nice side trip off the main highway but there's nothing to see but a small sign with limited details. Wish there was more about the Santa Fe Trail crossing which was apparently important enough for someone to dig a well but those details aren't explained. It is a clean area for a quick leg stretch but not much else."

Santa Fe Trail Park,"840 Avenue N, Chase",Chase,4,1,38.3330244,-98.34057639999999,"point_of_interest, establishment","This small park has a few visible ruts from the Santa Fe Trail and an old Buffalo Wallow. There is a gravel parking area right off the road- probably big enough for 3-4 cars. A large sign put up by the Fort Larned Historical Society details the history of the site. The ruts themselves are visible, but probably would be easy to miss if you don't know what you are looking for. If you are interested in trail history, this site is great to see one of the few remaining physical ruts!"
