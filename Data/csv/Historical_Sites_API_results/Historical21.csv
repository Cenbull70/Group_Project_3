Miami County Kansas Historical Society & Museum,"12 E Peoria St, Paola",Paola,4.7,30,38.5727047,-94.8772177,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Visited to see the annual Miniature Art Exhibition hosted in the Museum. The exhibition is a must see as it showcases wide variety of miniature paintings from all over the world. The Museum on its own is well curated with various artifacts associated with local and Kansas history. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and answered every question with immense patience. Hidden jewel for history buffs."
Monticello Community Historical Society,"23860 W 83rd St, Shawnee",Shawnee,4.3,10,38.97801,-94.862608,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","Very small place with a focus on only one man who had a connection with Buffalo Bill Cody. It is an old converted fire station,  but there is barely any history about the station. Aside from one saved fire truck that was passed over.

The tour I got was heavily one sided in favor of white settlements. Native American tribes were described to me as Indians to be domesticated. The guide wasn't shy about his distaste and disappointment that some settlers married women from native tribes.

He made it a point to skirt around evidence that some settlements and farms in the area were built and maintained with the work of slaves. When I hinted to that, I was ignored. In that museum, the narrative is that black people and other minorites living in historical times were not worth the effort of research."

Watkins Community Museum-History,"1047 Massachusetts St, Lawrence",Lawrence,4.7,201,38.96397,-95.23611079999999,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment","A beautiful, historical bldg. Quite a detailed set of permanent exhibits. And they have 4 rotating exhibits so always come back to see what's  new. I had just an hour to spend here, it was enough to thoroughly examine one exhibit and most of another. The rest I just quickly looked at. Plan an afternoon to enjoy it leisurely. Then enjoy the local food places there are several very close by."

Historic Ottawa Trail Bridge (West),"JP95+V3, Ottawa",Ottawa,5,1,38.6196954,-95.2922834,"point_of_interest, establishment","I was born and raised in Ottawa, Kansas and ever sing I was a kid I always hung out with my friends down at the Ottawa second Steeet Dam. The Dam itself isn‚Äôt directly connected to this bridge but you can go through the woods like we used to do..

Or just leave Second Street Dam and enter Hope Cemetery, drive to the far northwestern corner and you‚Äôll find the wooden stairs leading up to the Flint Hills Nature Trail.

Follow the trail and you‚Äôll find this beautiful and historic 1903 Warren Truss Through bridge named the ‚ÄúHistoric Ottawa Trail Bridge (West)‚Äù. The city of Ottawa and others have beautifully restored this whole area and are working around the clock to restore and reconstruct the trail ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Many thanks for bringing this bridge back to life! I see so many more people back here hiking, biking, fishing and so much else since it‚Äôs been restored!
