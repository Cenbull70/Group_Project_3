Harvey P. Sutton House FLW,"602 Norris Ave, McCook",McCook,4.9,7,40.2029371,-100.6260304,"point_of_interest, establishment","A private residence and unexpected find in McCook, Nebraska.

It was open today or should be open today at 2:00 p.m. yet we are just too early and have many dots on our trip. The building is stone and looks very luck large inside and neat.

The docent was an excellent and interesting conveyor of the history of the Norris family and the house. We learned a lot about the life of George Norris in service to the people and left with a great respect for him. I wish we had representatives like him today.

No cost to tour the house but donations may be left inside the front door."

We reserved the house so that my family could all stay together while we attended my grandfather's funeral. There was more than enough room for all of my sisters, our spouses, and all of our children. The house was fully stocked and all we needed to worry about was ourselves and our personal effects. It took a lot of stress out of our trip and was so wonderful to be able to be surrounded by family with all of us under one roof throughout the stay. I cannot recommend Cameron's Colonial enough. We will definitely be using it for future stays."
Fike Park,Colby,Colby,4.6,172,39.4000358,-101.0446605,"park, point_of_interest, establishment",I drove all this way to find the mini statue of Liberty. The mini Statue of Liberty was put up by the boy scouts of America in the '50s. There are approximately 20 remaining in the state of Kansas. This would be my fourth statue of Liberty that I have visited. I am mainly upset that I could not add the Statue of Liberty have a new place. This should be added so that people can find it. These monuments are disappearing daily because no one list them. As someone who likes to visit off the wall or off the beaten path tourist attractions this would have been a great find. Yeah I had to find the location on Wikipedia. I intend to visit all of the locations in the state of Kansas.
Historic Philip Houston House B&B,"350 Kansas Ave, Rexford",Rexford,4.6,8,39.4698981,-100.7427046,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This historic home is so beautiful and ornate. The owner knows the entire history of the house and how the original family lived in it. Each room is named after one of the original family members and is furnished with period pieces. This is the perfect place for rest and rejuvenation for travelers and locals alike.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."
George Norris Park,McCook,McCook,4.6,51,40.2041911,-100.625038,"park, point_of_interest, establishment","Several types of playground equipment, both old and new, benches for parents and grandparents to sit while they watch their children and grandchildren show off.

The Landmark Inn,"189 S Penn Ave, Oberlin",Oberlin,4.8,82,39.81913369999999,-100.5292684,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","Get ready to be transported back to the turn of the century. Every room is wonderfully appointed with authentic antiques and decor. The high ceilings provide a sense that the rooms are far larger than they really are. The beds are very comfortable and you'll lack for none of the usual modern amenities. The owner is impeccably friendly and helpful. The breakfast was incredible with eggs, sausage, fresh fruit, homemade scones, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and wonderful coffee. All this was consumed in the Teller Room Restaurant, the hotel's beautifully decorated restaurant housed in the former lobby of the historic Bank of Oberlin. Want to feel like early-20th century American aristocracy, stay here. Even our four children aged 11 to 4 absolutely loved their stay here. This place is wonderful if you're passing through on your way to parts unknown, or if you're looking for a place to stay a while to experience the historic plains."
