Fort Hays State Historic Site,"1472 US Highway 183 Alt, Hays",Hays,4.6,222,38.862995,-99.341484,"tourist_attraction, museum, point_of_interest, establishment","This is a great place to see how the old forts were laid out during the westward expansion. They have been able to preserve two of the officers' homes and the enlisted men's barracks. The foundations are shown for the commanding officer's home that was sadly sold and moved away. Even the officer's outhouse is there!

The museum part of the visitor center is well done, and the short movies are well done. They have dealt with culturally sensitive topics, too.

I highly recommend seeing this site if you are traveling through or if you live there. Great for all ages."

Frontier Historical Park,"Old Hwy 40, Hays",Hays,4.6,336,38.8637386,-99.3389522,"park, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped at Frontier Historical Park to specifically see the bison, notably the ‘ghost buffalo,’ Ghostbuster. We were surprised to see/learn that Ghostbuster was brought in many years ago, and there is a brand new, unadvertised even more white baby bison who joined the herd. We were lucky that the bison were all hanging near the fence at the southeast corner of their pasture, and we could get great views and photos. Definitely worth a stop! We didn’t check out the rest of the park, but it’s looks beautiful and has a well-maintained disc golf course."

Castle Rock,Larrabee,Larrabee,4.6,82,38.861122,-100.169852,"natural_feature, establishment",Really cool rock formations. It can be a rough road yet we drove it with a car and had no problems. If no different than the gravel road getting here. We drove from monument Rock to here through the back road. The further you drive the rougher it can get yet it's still passable. It's a quite a distance to get to the actual Castle Rock structure formation rock.

The location is about 20 minutes from Hays, so have a cooler for the cold grocery bits in the summer. The Trappers Lodge (there’s a dorm room fridge and microwave in the cabin) has a fun feel to it, and was a great location for viewing the Milky Way at night. Dogs are allowed for an additional fee and have to be on a leash. Next time we’re in that part of Kansas, we’ll be staying at these cabins."
