Haystack Mound,"R3F9+VM, Brookville",Brookville,5,2,38.824631,-97.9308,"point_of_interest, establishment","Another ancient Native American spiritual mound. This one is a precise conical mound shaped like a stack of strewn hay, hence the name given to this West Saline County natural & artificially man-made by a previous indigenous culture that spanned this area, predominantly Ellsworth and Rice Counties just to the West  and South Southwest of this mound. Nearby Native American mounds that are also nearby are the
•TWIN MOUNDS- in NW Saline Co. (Glendale)

•NORTH POLE MOUND- on the Northern Saline and SouthOttawa Co. line

•IRON MOUND-a few miles east of Salina is a platform Mound that looks just like Monk's Mound in Cahokia

•SOLDIER'S CAP MOUND- a tabletop Mound on the Smoky Hill Weapons Range

•TWIN MOUNDS- near Roxbury in Northern McPherson and SE Saline County.

•CORONADO HEIGHTS- Yep, even Coronado Heights was an ancient Mound that the WPA built a castle on top of in the 1930's proclaiming Francisco Coronado was here. (In truth, this is wrong it was actually SSW of Lindsborg somewhere closer to Lyons or Little River, Kansas area)."

Site of First Free Ferry on Smoky Hill River Marker,"115-101 S 4th St, Salina",Salina,5,1,38.8404167,-97.6069887,"point_of_interest, establishment","When I was growing up in Salina I never knew the importance of Iron Street for the old bridge that used to be there. Since Salina was founded primarily around Iron Ave & Santa Fe, more precisely (Iron Ave & 5th St), which on the SW corner where Carol Lee Donuts is now used to sit the first dwelling ever built in Salina in the year 1858. That little tidbit of information knowing where Salina Kansas was first founded will explain the reason why the exact center of where streets become directionally divided is based at Iron Ave & Santa Fe Ave. [i.e. Anything house or business address that sits N of Iron Ave is designated as North in the address, anything S is South. Also, anything that sits E of Santa Fe Ave is East in the address, and vice-versa anything W of Santa Fe Ave is West. For instance Salina Community Theater is 303 East Iron and the Smoky Hill Museum is 211 West Iron.]"
