Mingo - Oldest Active Geocache in the World,Colby,Colby,4.9,64,39.277916,-100.9436992,"point_of_interest, establishment","The new plaque was stolen, apparently. Still a neat piece of obscure history. Biked through en route from Fort Collins CO to Oakley KS. A minivan pulled up as we were leaving to continue east... this cache must see dozens of daily visitors!"
Cupelo House,"WWQF+M2, Russell Springs",Russell Springs,0,0,38.939157,-101.077495,"point_of_interest, establishment",No description available
Butterfield Trail Museum,"515 Hilts Ave, Russell Springs",Russell Springs,4.7,14,38.9123597,-101.1804207,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",Excellent collection of history for the area. Gorgeous old courthouse! Well worth the stop!
Fort Wallace Museum,"2655 U.S. Hwy 40, Wallace",Wallace,4.7,262,38.9103451,-101.5828513,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",This was a great stop for my 1 yo and 3 yo. So much they are allowed to touch and explore. They have dinosaurs and trains and butter churners and play horses to ride. It was so much great stuff to learn and so much fun stuff to explore.
Prairie Museum-Art & History,"1905 S Franklin Ave, Colby",Colby,4.7,160,39.3690406,-101.0449853,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","Great expansive museum of collections and preserved local buildings. Not the best stop on i-70 for a quick activity, one could spend 2 hours here easily. The fick fossil museum is better for a quick stop."
"Western Vistas Historic Byway, Kansas","2655 U.S. Hwy 40, Wallace",Wallace,0,0,38.9103372,-101.5829642,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",No description available
Fick Fossil & History Museum,"Bertrand Park, 700 W 3rd St, Oakley",Oakley,4.7,221,39.1279519,-100.8616602,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Really interesting place. Have a number of exhibits on display. There are fossils including a large fossilized fish. There are a number of displays for things like telegraphs military clothing and things of that nature. There's a large fire truck in one room which is really cool and very pretty. I had an overall great experience here that was free and it was a long hour route.
Cooper Barn,Colby,Colby,4.6,27,39.36925480000001,-101.0438679,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment",Definitely the best part of the Prairie Art and History Museum. The size of this barn is not believable until you enter the second floor!
Gove County Historical Museum,"420 5th St, Gove City",Gove City,0,0,38.9575696,-100.4833639,"museum, point_of_interest, establishment",No description available
Buffalo Bill Cultural Center,"3083 US-83, Oakley",Oakley,4.6,499,39.1269748,-100.8698706,"tourist_attraction, travel_agency, point_of_interest, establishment","This was a nice stop as we explored the little town of Oakley. Free and open to the public. Outside is a path you can walk up to view the Buffalo Bill statue. Inside features a gift shop, coffee, restrooms, educational displays, and a 10 panel hand painted mural of Kansas history. It's a must see. A very inviting and pleasant cultural center to learn more about Kansas and pick up free travel brochures."
Fort Wallace Post Cemetery,Wallace,Wallace,4.7,10,38.9029021,-101.5595393,"cemetery, point_of_interest, establishment",this  is  where  the  actual  fort  was  located  though  nothing  remains  except  the  cemetery.   A  good  GPS  app  or  a  state atlas  is  recommended  to  find  this  place.  A  more  challenging  place  to  find  but  worth  the  effort.
Fike Park,Colby,Colby,4.6,172,39.4000358,-101.0446605,"park, point_of_interest, establishment",I drove all this way to find the mini statue of Liberty. The mini Statue of Liberty was put up by the boy scouts of America in the '50s. There are approximately 20 remaining in the state of Kansas. This would be my fourth statue of Liberty that I have visited. I am mainly upset that I could not add the Statue of Liberty have a new place. This should be added so that people can find it. These monuments are disappearing daily because no one list them. As someone who likes to visit off the wall or off the beaten path tourist attractions this would have been a great find. Yeah I had to find the location on Wikipedia. I intend to visit all of the locations in the state of Kansas.
Historic Philip Houston House B&B,"350 Kansas Ave, Rexford",Rexford,4.6,8,39.4698981,-100.7427046,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","This historic home is so beautiful and ornate. The owner knows the entire history of the house and how the original family lived in it. Each room is named after one of the original family members and is furnished with period pieces. This is the perfect place for rest and rejuvenation for travelers and locals alike.

Just a short drive from neighboring towns with full restaurant and grocery amenities, Rexford has all the peace, privacy, and fresh air you need. Colby, Hoxie, and Oakley are all a short drive and have really good eateries. I recommend the family owned and local restaurants as they have all been great that we have tried, but they have chain brands too if that makes you more comfortable.

The house has a gorgeous and large dining table, fully equipped kitchen, and two indoor sitting areas (in addition to the pastor's library), as well as a wrap around porch for outdoor seating, morning coffee, and just catching the morning breeze (which is one of my favorite things to do when in Rexford).

The owner and staff are so kind and interesting to talk to. We have sincerely enjoyed our time with them.

This house also has a Pastor's Suite complete with books from seminary and other topics to read and reflect, and she offers refuge for pastors and church leadership in this way. It has a bookshelf devoted to books specifically on women in ministry, which is uplifting and encouraging."
St. Thomas Historic Residences,"200 S Range Ave, Colby",Colby,1,3,39.3930944,-101.0551821,"point_of_interest, establishment","If I could give less than 1 star I would.  This place is not a good place to live.  The property manager is never around and we can't even get ahold of her via phone. We've been told not to contact her unless it's an emergency.  We are no longer allowed to use the limited outdoor facilities such as the gazebo or the provided outdoor grill.  If we leave anything outside, the manager will throw it out if she sees it (willful destruction of property, by the way).  Additionally, the lifts and elevator are constantly breaking down and take a week (or longer - the lift took 6+ months for someone to finally come fix it), leaving elderly residents and residents with health/mobility issues stranded (which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by the way).  Our rent continues to increase and the property manager does not provide explanation OR copies of rental agreements (again, unlawful).  Maintenance issues are a continuing issue - my own apartment has a leaky roof in various areas, the windows have faulty seals and need maintenance, the stove is faulty and will short out the entire apartment if we attempt to use one side, and our refrigerator/freezer is broken and needs maintenance.  The grounds and drive need maintenance to fix potholes.  I have attempted to contact the property owners but never receive a reply.  These are only SOME of the issues residents are experiencing at this location and with this property manager, and something needs to be done.  I shouldn't have to write this review under a pseudonym just to avoid retribution, either, but here we are."
The Memory Bank and Wallace Trading Company,"202 2nd St, Wallace",Wallace,5,32,38.9133139,-101.5916122,"cafe, food, home_goods_store, store, point_of_interest, establishment",Fabulous little shop! The owner has excellent taste and an eye for how to style each item well. Reasonable prices too!
Big Ed's,"106 W Bressler, Bird City",Bird City,4.5,381,39.7497704,-101.5332395,"bar, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment","This is really a diamond in the rough. I had a delightful few days visiting in laws in Bird City. Although it’s flat, dry, and small, Bird City is hospitable, neighborly, and friendly.

Big Ed’s seems to be the social heart of town.  I have never had a rib-eye before, but this steak was a scrumptious treat. It was 34 oz., and not too expensive for its high quality."
The Logan House,Russell Springs,Russell Springs,5,4,38.9129294,-101.1724848,"lodging, point_of_interest, establishment","A solitary piece of Kansas Prairie Americana, harkening the ebbing days of the Indian Wars, the homesteader, and the Westward Ho days of the wagon train. A beautiful place to rest and listen for the voices of the past whispering through the Prairie wind. Much thanks to the innkeepers."
