Webster State Park,"1140 10 Rd, Stockton",Stockton,4.6,262,39.421989,-99.4342088,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Webster is a very expansive park with numerous campgrounds within.  We stayed in Hill Top where about half of the sites were pull through, all in the sun, gravel, water, electricity.  We were there during a hazardous bacteria warning for the water so we could not take advantage of the beaches or fishing, but I'd guess it is usually lovely and a great place for families.  Some of the roads to get into the campgrounds have big chunks missing or pot holes which can be hard on tow vehicles and RVs.  Other campgrounds (old marina and eagle view) within the Park had sites with much more shade and they were lovely.  Bath houses were clean (the ones we used).  No dumpster or bathroom/house in Hill Top.  We saw some wildlife-hog nosed snake racoon, lots of birds.  Stockton is just 10 minutes away and they have dinner good things for kids-parks, playgrounds, public pool.  Our purpose for being in the area was visiting Nicodemus national historical site."
