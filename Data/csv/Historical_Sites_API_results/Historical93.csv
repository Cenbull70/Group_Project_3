St Jacob's Well,Ashland,Ashland,4.7,18,37.2403698,-99.9818331,"tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","It was an interesting place.  The road that leads to the well is quite rough.  I wasn't even sure if vehicles were allowed on it.  I started walking, but turned back to grab my car due to the how hot it was and not having planned to hike.  I drove as far as I could, about 1 mile, until I came across a rut several feet long that I didn't know if I could squeeze by, so I parked in the grass and walked the rest of the way.  Aside from being rough, the road is also only wide enough for one vehicle.  There are a few flat pull off areas, but it'd still be tricky if you approached a vehicle coming the opposite direction.  I was there on a Summer day and didn't see anyone, so chances are you'll have the place almost to yourself.  I spent about 15 minutes at the well and the area on top of the hill by the windmill, before walking back to my car.  I didn't check out the Living Water Monument, so I can't speak on that or the road leading to it.  Surprisingly, I didn't find any ticks on me, but it was grasshopper galore.  I arrived back at my car to find roughly 20 or 30 of them on my front bumper.  If you came when the weather is nice, there's a lot of hiking opportunity if you're willing to just walk the roads instead of driving.  It was a nice place to see, but I'm not sure I'll go back."
Dorothy's House and the Land of Oz,"567 E Cedar St, Liberal",Liberal,4.3,1016,37.0345435,-100.9105968,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","This was a cute place. I didn't do the tour, I just viewed the museum and bought souvenirs from the gift shop. The cashier was very kind and we enjoyed a chat while I shopped. Definitely worth stopping in! I included pics from the entrance."
Jones & Plummer Trail Museum,"1107 Douglas Ave, Beaver",Beaver,4.5,16,36.8072051,-100.5203323,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","We stopped here on our way across the Oklahoma panhandle. We were looking for a little break and a chance to get out of the car. This was a great stop! The museum curator was knowledgeable, helpful and interesting. She had a passion for the museum and it showed! A great selection of items to look through and thoughtfully arranged. The rooms just kept going on and on.  If you enjoy museums, this is well worth your time."
