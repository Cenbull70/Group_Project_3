Battle of Carthage State Historic Site,"1111 E Chestnut St, Carthage",Carthage,4.3,192,37.1737617,-94.2977805,"tourist_attraction, park, point_of_interest, establishment","Easy to find historical site in the town of Carthage. I visited in December so had no issues with bugs as others reported.  The trail goes up by the spring and crosses over the top of rock outcroppings. Pretty walk. Easy enough for families but would advise that there are no railings for safety if you have very small children. It loops back across the lawn, and depending on water flow, you may have to contend with a wet crossing at the far end. The site was not trashed up, but there are no trash cans, so pack out trash to preserve the beauty. There are also no facilities of any kind but a couple of picnic tables that would be shady in the summer.  The open lawn might be a fun spot for a game of frisbee though!"
Battle of Carthage Civil War Museum,"205 Grant St, Carthage",Carthage,4.6,208,37.177571,-94.30983379999999,"museum, tourist_attraction, point_of_interest, establishment","I say if you have a chance to go here, GO!! It is so worth it! It's a wonderful story of our history, and they do well with the telling of the battle. I'm framing one of the artists' paintings, and I'll update this when I get it in."
