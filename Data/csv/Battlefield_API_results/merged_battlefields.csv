We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."

One hour on the arena floor to battle with a ref. Then, an hour in room with pizza and water. They supplied plastic covers, plates, and napkins too. We brought cupcakes, cookies, and Capri sun drinks. Don't forget to bring cash for arcade, they have quarter machines. They kids had a blast playing games and attempting their luck at the claw machines."
