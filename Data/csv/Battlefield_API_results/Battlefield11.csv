We came to the area for Little Jerusalem and were extremely disappointed due to what we were expecting. Since our expectations were already demolished, this place was such a pleasant surprise. The trails were well worn and fun to walk. The cave was full of water and seemed neat. There was plenty of plaques for reading to learn about the area making it a great stop."
