One hour on the arena floor to battle with a ref. Then, an hour in room with pizza and water. They supplied plastic covers, plates, and napkins too. We brought cupcakes, cookies, and Capri sun drinks. Don't forget to bring cash for arcade, they have quarter machines. They kids had a blast playing games and attempting their luck at the claw machines."
